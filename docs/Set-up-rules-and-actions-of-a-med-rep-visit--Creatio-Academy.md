 Visit rules determine the different types of visits and med rep’s “to-do” list for each visit type. This enables you to plan med rep visits with a few clicks, as Creatio will populate the properties of each visit automatically, according to applicable visit rule.
 



 You can set up rules for physician and pharmacy visits, as well as the list of activities that your employees must follow during visits. For example, the first step of any visit is the “Check-in“ action, which confirms that the med rep has actually arrived at the visit site. Completing this action will automatically save the information about the employee's location. Other visit activities may include presentation of new products, order placement and “Check-out“.

	 Start
	 
	 and
	 
	 Due
	 
	 fields, specify the time limit of rule validity.
	3. Specify visit duration (including travel time) in the corresponding field. The specified duration will be used by the system when creating visit activities.
	4. In the
	 
	 Number of visits
	 
	 field, enter the approximate number of visits of this type that a med rep can perform during one day.
	5. In the
	 
	 Visit category
	 
	 field, select the “Visit to the doctor” or “Visit to the pharmacy” value.
6. Save the changes.
7. Similarly, specify the other rules. Normally, different visit rules apply to different periods and locations.
   

 As a result, these rules will be taken into account when building a schedule for the med reps. If several rules can be applied to a sales outlet, Creatio will let you choose which rule to use.

 rules. You can supplement the list of available action types by adding the needed types to the
 
 Action types
 
 lookup. Med rep can complete an action by toggling a switch in the mobile device. The connection between visit actions and system sections (e.g., creating a new contract based on a visit action) is carried out only through development.

 Attachments
 
 detail.







 Set up a list of promoted products
----------------------------------------



 When monitoring SKU, a med rep must only see a list of products promoted via a doctor or pharmacy. This is done by setting up individual lists of promoted products for each customer contact or account. There are two ways to do this.
 



 To set up the list of products promoted via
 **accounts** 
 :
 


* Go to the
 
 Accounts
 
 detail of the product page and add the list of all accounts that promote the product. The information about the product will be automatically added to the
 
 Products
 
 detail of an account page.
* Add the promoted products to the
 
 Products
 
 detail of the account page of the account where the products must be promoted. The information about accounts will be added to the
 
 Accounts
 
 detail of the product page.



 To set up the list of products promoted via
 **contacts** 
 :
 


* Go to the
 
 Contacts
 
 detail of the product page and add the list of all contacts that promote the product. The information about the product will be automatically added to the
 
 Products
 
 detail of a contact page.
* Alternatively, add the promoted products to the
 
 Products
 
 detail of the contact page of the contact who promotes the product. The information about the product will be automatically added to the
 
 Products
 
 detail of a contact page.



 As a result, the connection between promoted products and accounts/contacts will be set. During a visit to a pharmacy, when performing the
 
 SKU monitoring
 
 action, a med rep will see only the products promoted via this account. During a visit to a doctor, when performing the
 
 Promoted products
 
 action, a med rep will see only the products promoted via this contact.
 





 Note.
 
 If an account has more than one subsidiary companies, when adding products to the
 
 Products
 
 tab of the parent company, added products will appear on the corresponding tabs of the subsidiary companies. However, when adding new products to subsidiary company pages, the products will not be added to the parent company page. When deleting products from the
 
 Products
 
 tab of the parent company, the products will not be removed from the subsidiary companies’ pages.
