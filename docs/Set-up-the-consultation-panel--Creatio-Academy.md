 button on the side panel to open the consultation panel.
   

 Use the consultation panel to search the client database, select consultation themes, postpone or end the consultation, as well as view additional information about the client, such as previous applications, noteworthy events, and individual offers.
   

 Before you start using the consultation panel, you need to set up the list of blocks, groups, and themes of consultations. You can customize the rules for searching clients by name or phone number, as well as rules for displaying clients' noteworthy events.
 



 Set up consultation blocks and themes
---------------------------------------



 When communicating with the client using the consultation panel, the manager can select consultation themes.
   

 The consultation themes are displayed as buttons grouped by blocks. For example, the
 
 Sell
 
 block contains themes that are connected with selling bank products. Similar themes can be combined into groups. Groups of themes can be identified by the
 
 >
 
 character on the right (Fig. 1). Click a theme group to open the list of themes that are combined in the group.
