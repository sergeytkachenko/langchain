 Once you add a
 
[Block](/docs/8-0/user/marketing_tools/email_marketing/email_templates/content_block/set_up_a_content_block#HT_chapter_content_designer_element_block)

 element to a template and populate its sections and columns with other content designer elements, you can save this block in the Content block library for future use. The list of blocks from the content block library is displayed on the left side of the Content Designer. Drag&drop ready-made blocks from the library to the working area to add them to your email or edit them (Fig. 1).

 Save a custom content block in the library
------------------------------------------------


1. Open the template that contains the needed block in the Content Designer.
2. If necessary, modify an existing block or create a new one.
3. Make sure that the desired
 
 Block
 
 element is selected.
4. Click
 ![scr_block_context_menu_save_icon.png](/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/email_marketing/BPMonlineHelp/email_marketing_save_block/scr_block_context_menu_save_icon.png)
 in the context menu on the right. A prompt box will pop up.
5. Populate the
 
 Block name
 
 field. This name will display under this content block in the block library.
   

 We recommend naming the blocks in a way that would describe their contents and purpose of the content block. Such an approach helps find the content block when you work with templates in the Content Designer.
6. Click
 
 Save
 
 (Fig. 1).
