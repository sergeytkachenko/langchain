 Creatio implements the "Configuration management"/"Asset management" ITSM process in the
 
 Configuration items
 
 section. Use this section to manage information about your configuration items (CI) to keep them operational and maintain the high quality of the service delivery.
 





 Note.
 
 A “configuration item” in Creatio represents some form of software or hardware that affects the provided IT services.

 Configuration item category, for example, “Peripherals” or “Software.”
  |
| 
 Type
  | 
 Configuration item type, for example, “Printer” or “Operating system.” A list of possible values for this field depends on the selected configuration item. Configuration item type dependency on the category is defined in the
 
 CI types
 
 lookup.
  |
| 
 Model
  | 
 Model of the configuration item. A list of possible values for this field depends on the type of the selected configuration item. Configuration item model dependency on the category is defined in the
 
 CI models
 
 lookup.

 Link assets with services to create a service model
-----------------------------------------------------------



 A
 **service model** 
 is a diagram that displays dependencies between various elements in the IT infrastructure. The model is based on the connections between the services and the configuration items.
 



 To create a service model for a configuration item:
 


1. In the
 
 Configuration items
 
 section, open the record to specify the services and connected configuration items.
2. Click the
 
 Connected to
 
 tab.
3. Click
 ![btn_com_add_tab00003.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_configuration_items/btn_com_add_tab00003.png)
 on the
 
 Services
 
 detail. A new record with blank fields will appear on the detail.
4. Select the connection category with the service in the
 
 Category
 
 field (
 [Fig. 1](#XREF_79270_96)
 ):
 





 Fig. 1
 

 Selecting the connection category
 

![scr_specs_services_connected_category.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_configuration_items/scr_specs_services_connected_category.png)


1. Select the "Dependent" connection category to add a link to a service, whose delivery depends on the current configuration item.
2. Select the "Influencer" connection category to add a link to a service whose operation affects the current configuration item.
3. In the
 
 Service
 
 field, select the linked service. For example, the "WiFi access" service depends on the "Router" configuration item (
 [Fig. 2](#XREF_13770_97)
 ).
 





 Fig. 2
 

 Selecting the connected configuration item
 

![scr_specs_services_connected_ci.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_configuration_items/scr_specs_services_connected_ci.png)
4. In the
 
 Type
 
 field, select a short description of connections between the current configuration item and the selected service. For example, the "Required for" connection type can be specified for the "WiFi access" service and the "Router" configuration item (
 [Fig. 3](#XREF_46967_98)
 ).
 





 Fig. 3
 

 Selecting the connection type
 

![scr_specs_services_connected_type.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_configuration_items/scr_specs_services_connected_type.png)



 As a result, you will create a
 **connection** 
 between the service and the configuration item. If you selected the “Influencer” category, the corresponding service will have an
 **inverse relation** 
 (i.e., “Dependent”) on the
 
 Connected to
 
 tab of the
 
 Configuration items
 
 detail. The
 
 Type
 
 field of the inverse relationship will be automatically populated with the inverse connection type according to the “
 **Object dependency type** 
 ” lookup content. For example, if the type of the connection is “Required for,” the inverse relation is “Installed on.”
5. Specify other connections to the configuration items.
6. Add connections to the relevant configuration items by clicking
 ![btn_com_add_tab00004.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_configuration_items/btn_com_add_tab00004.png)
 on the
 
 Connected configuration item
 
 detail. The procedure for linking configuration items is similar to that of linking services (see steps 3-6).
7. If required, open the
 
 Services
 
 section and add the missing connections between the services.
 



 As a result, Creatio will add connections between the services and configuration items which make the visual display of the service model possible when handling the cases or planning the changes.
