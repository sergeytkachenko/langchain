 The
 
 Queues
 
 section enables you to manage calls and case processing sequence. Increase the efficiency of your contact center by creating queues tailored to your company-specific features, customer history, and case priority.
 



 The
 
 Queues
 
 section provides contact center or support team supervisors with the instruments to efficiently manage incoming and outgoing communications. Customization enables you to plan for a constant flow of cases, define priorities, and assign employees. Although typical queue elements are cases you can set up queues for other system objects, such as accounts and contacts.
 



 After the queues have been set up, the agent desktop will display the list of records for processing. The content of the list depends on the following:
 


* the object the queue is created for;
* queue population type (static or dynamic);
* queue display type (regular or blind).



 Default queue objects include
 
 “Contact”
 
 ,
 
 “Account”
 
 ,
 
 “Case”
 
 . You can set up queues for other objects. A list of the queue objects can be found in the
 
 Queue objects
 
 lookup. The content of all queues for each object will be displayed on a separate tab on the agent desktop. For example, cases are displayed on the
 
 Cases
 
 tab of the agent desktop.
 



 Queues can be populated manually or automatically.
 
 Static
 
 queues are populated manually and are commonly used for campaigns with a set timeframe and target audiences, such as limited-time promotional offers.
 
 DYNAMIC
 
 queues are filled in automatically as the records are created or modified in the system. Such queues are a good option, e.g., for prioritizing the CC incoming cases. The type of queue population is determined when a queue is created.
 



 You can also control whether the agents can choose which record to take next. When working with
 
 open
 
 queues, agents can choose which record to take next. The order of the records depends on the record sorting rules on the agent desktop. Agents who work with
 
 blind
 
 queues can take only the next record in queue. In a blind queue, an agent can take the next record only after processing the previous one.
 



 Queues with one display type (open or closed) can be created for one object.
