 Note.
 
 We recommend filling out the
 
 Description
 
 field when you create a case to ensure support agents receive as much information about the case as possible. If you leave the
 
 Description
 
 field empty when you create a case, Creatio will populate the field with the value of the
 
 Category
 
 field.

 You receive a push notification when a support specialist sends you a new message. To reply to the message:
 


1. Go the
 
 Cases
 
 section. To do this, tap
