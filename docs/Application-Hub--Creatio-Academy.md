 Use the Creatio Application Hub to collaborate on apps of any complexity in the No-Code Designer.
 



 Open the Application Hub in the System Designer or by clicking
 ![btn_sys_designer.png](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/btn_sys_designer.png)
 in the top right →
 
 Application Hub
 
 .
 



 This lets you organize team cooperation during the app setup and testing stage efficiently.
 



 Every employee can access the implemented solutions and environments where the work is in progress.
 



 The Application Hub is available in both Creatio cloud and on-site. The entirety of the Application Hub functionality covered in this article is available in Creatio cloud. Creatio on-site, as well as environments that are not connected to an organization, display the section with the apps of a specific environment without the ability to switch between environments, invite users, and manage the profile.
 



 Once you complete your registration with the Application Hub, you will have a user account and an organization account.
 





 Note.
 
 A free organization is added automatically when you order Creatio trial. Existing customers gain access to their environments and receive automatic bindings.
 



* A
 **user account** 
 is required to log in to the Application Hub and environments.
* An
 **organization account** 
 is required to share apps and collaborate on them with coworkers. By default, every new user who registers on their own (as opposed to following an invite link in the email) has an organization account. To
 **collaborate** 
 in the Application Hub, invite team members. Set the team member permissions using the following roles:
	1. **Administrator** 
	 has full access to company environments and permissions to manage them. In addition to the edit privileges, an administrator can invite other users for collaboration or remove users from the organization. An organization can have more than one administrator, but at least one administrator is required.
	2. **Developer** 
	 has full access to development and testing environments, as well as trials ordered by the organization’s employees. An organization can have more than one developer, but at least one developer is required.



 If one of the administrators deletes their user account, other team members can continue working on the apps of the organization. The last remaining administrator user cannot be deleted from an organization.

 Select an operating environment
---------------------------------



 The Application Hub contains a unified library of your company’s environments. Use the library to organize site customization efforts.
 



 To view the list of available environments, click the menu in the top right (Fig. 5).
 




 Fig. 5 The list of environments in the Application Hub
 

![app_hub_choose.png](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/ApplicationHub/app_hub_choose.png)



 The list of environments displays both current the cloud environments of your company and trials ordered by the organization participants. Creatio displays the current status of each environment using the icon to the left of the environment.
 



 You can switch between the environments of your organization without repeated logging in. This is achieved with Creatio ID functionality based on the SSO mechanism. After you sign up with the Application Hub, you can open any site of your organization so long as you have permissions to access the site. When you log in to the site, Creatio automatically adds a user account linked to the main account in the application hub.
 



 You can
 **select** 
 the environment and proceed to manage its apps, the environment itself, or open the configuration (Fig. 6).
