 Use
 
 Area
 
 and
 
 Columns
 
 grid containers to group Freedom UI elements into a rigid layout that can include columns.
 





 Example.
 
 Set up a grid container that includes 3 columns to the request page. Ensure the container is noticeable easily.

1. Drag a
 
 3 columns
 
 layout element to the canvas and open the element setup area.
2. Specify into how many columns to divide the block in the
 
 Number of columns
 
 parameter. For this example, leave the parameter as is.
3. Click the
 ![btn_visible.png](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/element_setup_examples/btn_visible.png)
 or
 ![btn_not_visible.png](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCodePlatform/element_setup_examples/btn_not_visible.png)
 button in the
 
 Visibility
 
 group to make the layout element visible or invisible by default on the page, respectively. For this example, leave the layout element visible.
4. Click
 
 Setup conditions
 
 in the
 
 Visibility
 
 group to set up element business rules. For this example, do not add business rules. Learn more about setting up business rules in a separate article:
 [Set up business rules](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2409) 
 .
5. Set the background color of the container in the
 
 Color
 
 parameter. For this example, select light orange (#FDEDCC hex code).
6. Set the distance between columns in the
 
 Column spacing
 
 parameter. For this example, select “Medium.”
7. Set the distance between rows in the
 
 Row spacing
 
 parameter. For this example, select “Small.”
8. Specify the radii of area corners in the
 
 Border radius
 
 parameter. For this example, select “Medium.”
9. Set the internal margins in the
 
 Spacing
 
 group. For this example, leave all margins at “None.”
10. View the unique element code in the page schema in the
 
 Element code
 
 parameter. Creatio uses this code in page schemas. You can change it if needed. This helps software developers to customize the app easier, especially if you have multiple similar elements on the page. For this example, leave the code as is.



 As a result, Creatio will add a light orange grid container that includes 3 columns to the request page.
