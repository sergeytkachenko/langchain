 When working with Creatio, you may need to clear the change log history to avoid storing outdated log records in Creatio. For example, you can clear the log records of a specific contract created within the specified period of time.
 





 Note.
 
 We recommend clearing the change log regularly to ensure that the
 
 Change log
 
 section contains only the currently valid information.
 



1. Open the System Designer, e.g., by clicking
 ![btn_system_designer.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/logging_tools/BPMonlineHelp/clear_change_log/btn_system_designer.png)
 .
2. Under
 
 Users and administration
 
 , click
 
 Change log
 
 .
3. Click
 
 Actions
 
 →
 
 Clear log
 
 .
 





 Note.
 
 Deleting records in the change log requires permission to the
 
 Can clear change log
 
 (CanClearChangeLog) system operation permission.
   

 Learn more about using system operations in the “

4. Select the objects whose log records must be cleared and specify the period for which to clear the record. Click
 
 Clear
