 After
 [connecting](/docs/node/777/%26#9;) 
 Creatio to landing, some fields on Creatio lead pages may be omitted in the customer web form. You can set up autofill for such fields depending on your landing page specifics and purpose.
 



 We recommend that you start with setting up the autofill defaults for the
 
 Need type
 
 and
 
 Need maturity
 
 fields. For example, the subscription form for your hardware special offer can automatically be connected to the “Hardware” need type. Your web form for the customers who are ready to communicate in person or to place an order can be connected to the need maturity values: “Discovered” or “Sales-ready.”
 



 On the
 
 Default values
 
 tab, you can set up the autofill defaults for the lead page fields. You can set up the autofill feature for any field type including the mapped ones. In this case, the default value will be filled in the lead page field only if the customer left it blank.
 



 To set up autofill of the lead fields:
 


1. Go to the
 
 Default values
 
 tab of the landing page. Click the

 button on the
 
 Default values for the lead fields
 
 detail (Fig. 1).
