7. Click
 
 Install
 
 on the Wizard page. The installation may take several minutes to finish. Wait for the process to complete before taking any further action.



 Install an app from a file
----------------------------



 You can also install an app
 **from a \*.zip or \*.gz file** 
 . This method can be more convenient for Creatio on-site users who have limited access for external requests. To do this:
 


1. Open the needed app → the
 
 Packages
 
 tab → download the Markeplace app files.
2. Click
 ![btn_system_designer.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/apps_and_extensions/BPMonlineHelp/apps_and_extensions/btn_system_designer.png)
 in the top right →
 
 Application Hub
 
 .
3. Click
 
 New application
 
 . This opens a window.
4. Select
 
 Install from file
 
 and click
 
 Select
 
 in the window that opens.
5. Click
 
 Select file
 
 on the page of the Marketplace App Installation Wizard and specify the app file path.
 



 Once you select the file, the installation will run automatically.



 As a result, Creatio will add the new app to the
 
 Application Hub
 
 section. You might need to add new sections to workplaces before you start working with the app.
 



 Install an app into an environment that uses a balancer
---------------------------------------------------------



 If you use a load balancer to ensure fault tolerance of your Creatio application, the install process for Marketplace apps differs. Install an app from a file into one Creatio instance, then transfer settings to other instances. Learn more in a separate article:
 [Compile an app on a web farm](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2410) 
 .
 



 Manage apps
-------------



 Creatio Marketplace provides both paid and free business solutions. Most paid apps have a
 **trial version** 
 you can install and use for a period to make the decision whether to purchase the app. After the trial period ends, purchase the app licenses or delete the app from your Creatio website.
 **Upload and distribute licenses** 
 for Marketplace apps similarly to uploading Creatio licenses. Learn more in a separate article:
