 All information about customer companies, partners, contractors or suppliers, or competitors in Creatio is stored in one place, up-to-date, and easily accessible at any time.
 



 Use the
 
 Accounts
 
 section of Creatio to keep a record of contact data, track connections between companies, group companies by various criteria, and analyze the relevant statistics. For example, the data on the number of employees can be used to estimate the size of the company.
 





 Note.
 
 The term “account” corresponds to “legal entity” in Financial Services Creatio products. Legal entities include customer companies, partners, competitor banks, subsidiaries, and branches of your bank, as well as insurance companies that you interact with. The
 
 Accounts
 
 section corresponds to the
 
 Legal entities
 
 section in Financial Services Creatio products.
