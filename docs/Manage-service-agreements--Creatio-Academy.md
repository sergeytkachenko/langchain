 Creatio implements the "Service level management" ITSM process in the
 
 Service agreements
 
 section. Use this section to determine the customer service requirements, manage your agreements, and in-house service agreements. For each agreement, you can define the individual terms of service and view the statistics.

 Type of service agreement:
 
	* SLA

	* UC
