8. The rest of the IMAP/SMTP server settings will be populated automatically. You can change them by selecting the needed option from the drop-down list to configure the mail server port and the security parameters.
 



**Set the inbound mail server port** 
 :
 


	1. Select “
	 **143** 
	 ” to use the port without encryption.
	2. Select “
	 **993** 
	 ” to use the port for a secure connection.
**Set the security parameters of the inbound mail server** 
 :
 


	1. Select “
	 **SSL/TLS** 
	 ” to use the standard data security protocol.
	2. Select “

	 option if users enter their email address and username.

	3. Select the
	 
	 Use mailbox name
	 
	 option if the part of the email address before “@” is used as a username. For example, the “test” will be a login for “test@google.com” email address.
**Set up the authentication method:** 



	1. Select “Basic” for the basic authentication using the user name and password with Base64 encryption.
	2. Select “OAuth 2.0” to restrict the service access to protected user resources without the need to pass the login and password. Populate the

	 and
	 
	 Client secret
	 
	 required fields.
	 
	 Application (client) ID
	 
	 is generated by the authentication server of the mail service. The documentation and API may refer to the application ID as “Product ID.”

	 – a secret key generated by the authentication server. The documentation and API may refer to the client secret as “Product key.”
