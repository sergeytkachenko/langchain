 One of the primary components of a visit rule is the sale rep “to-do” list – the activities that sales reps are required to complete during a visit. This functionality lets field staff perform the following
 
 basic actions on their mobile devices:
 





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
 Check-in
  | 
 Creatio receives GPS coordinates of the sales rep's location and the visit status is changed to “In progress“.
  |
| 
 Presentation
  | 
 Opens a PowerPoint or PDF presentation on the sales rep's mobile device (the presentation must be added to the
 
 Attachments and notes
 
 detail of the visit record in the
 
 Activities
 
 section). If several presentations have been added to the detail, the sales rep will have to select the needed one.
  |
| 
 Check-out
  | 
 When the action is performed, the system receives the GPS coordinates of the sales rep's location and the visit is assigned the “Completed“ status.
  |




 You can supplement the list of sales rep visit actions by adding new records to the
 
 Visit actions type
 
 lookup. Employees mark visit actions as “complete” by toggling a switch in the mobile device. The connection between visit actions and system sections (e.g., creating a new contract based on a visit action) is carried out only through development.
 













 Set up a med rep visit rule
---------------------------------------


1. Click
 ![btn_system_designer.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_set_rules_and_actions/btn_system_designer.png)
 in the main Creatio application.
2. Go to the
 
 System setup
 
 block –> click
 
 Lookups
 
 .
3. Click the
 
 Field sales rules
 
 lookup.
4. On the lookup content page, click the
 
 New rule
 
 button.
5. Populate the required fields:
 


	1. Populate the
	 
	 Name
	 
	 field, for example, “2nd quarter of 2020 (Downtown)“ or “1st quarter (Uptown)“.
	2. In the
	 
	 Start
	 
	 and
	 
	 Due
	 
	 fields, specify the time limit of rule validity.
	3. Specify visit duration (including travel time) in the corresponding field.
	4. In the
	 
	 Number of visits
	 
	 field, enter the approximate number of visits of this type that a field staff member can perform during one day.
6. Click
 
 Save
 
 .
7. Similarly, specify the other rules. For example, the rules may vary by the due date or depending on the location a sales rep is operating in.
 



 As a result, these rules will be taken into account when building a schedule for the sales reps.
 



 In the
 
 Visit scheduling
 
 view of the
 
 Activities
 
 section, drag a sales outlet from the list to the left and drop it into the calendar. The duration of the visit will be set automatically, according to the
 
 Visit duration
 
 value from the corresponding visit rule.
 



 If several rules can be applied to a sales outlet, Creatio will let you choose which rule to use.

5. On the rule page, expand the
 
 Actions during visit
 
 detail and click the
 
 Add
 
 button.
6. Populate the columns of the new record:
 


	1. Select the visit action type “Check-in,” “Check-out,” “Presentation,” etc.
	2. Use the
	 
	 Actions priority order
	 
	 column, to set up sequence of sales rep activities. For example, if the action is the first in the “to-do” list, enter “1“.
	3. Select the
	 
	 Required
	 
	 checkbox for the actions that should not be skipped during a visit.
	   
	
	 The sales rep will not be able to complete the visit until all the required actions are performed.
7. Click
 

![btn_com_apply.png](/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_com_apply.png)


 to save the visit action.
8. Similarly, add the rest of the visit actions.
 



 As a result, when you drag a sales outlet and drop it into the calendar in the
 
 Visit scheduling
 
 view of the
 
 Activities
 
 section, the
 
 Visit actions
 
 detail of the visit will be populated automatically. The list of actions on the detail will correspond to the list of actions set up in the lookup.











 Add a presentation to a visit
---------------------------------------



 The “Presentation“ visit action requires additional setup so that the field staff members have full access to the presentation materials.
 



 In the system, create a knowledge base article and add a PowerPoint presentation (\*.pptx) or PDF file on its
 
 Attachments
 
 detail. Then, link the article to the “Presentation” visit action. As a result, your sales reps will be able to show the attached presentation from their mobile device during visits.
 





 Note.
 
 You can add not just PowerPoint presentations but also any other documents to the knowledge base article. In this case, when performing the “Presentation“ action, this document will be opened using the default applications for that file type on the mobile device.
 




 To add a presentation:
 


1. Click
 ![btn_system_designer00002.png](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/sites/default/files/documentation/user/ru/field_sales/BPMonlineHelp/field_sales_set_rules_and_actions/btn_system_designer00002.png)
 in the main Creatio application.
2. Go to the
 
 System setup
 
 block –> click
 
 Lookups
 
 .
3. Click the
 
 Field sales rules
 
 lookup.
4. Open the needed rule and go to the
 
 Actions during visit
 
 detail.
5. Select the “Presentation” record and click
 

![btn_edit.png](/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_edit.png)


 .
6. On the displayed page, expand the
 
 Presentation
 
 detail and click
 
![btn_chapter_mobile_wizard_new_role.png](/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_chapter_mobile_wizard_new_role.png)

 .
7. In the displayed string, click
 

![btn_com_lookup.png](/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_com_lookup.png)


 in the field.
8. In the displayed lookup, select a knowledge base article with an attached presentation.
9. If necessary, add other knowledge base articles with attachments.
 



 As a result, when a field staff member performs the
 
 Presentation
 
 visit action, the PowerPoint presentation (or any other document) attached to the knowledge base article will open on their mobile device. All presentations and materials will be available on the
 
 Attachments and notes
 
 detail of the visit.
 



 Also, all visits planned in the calendar (the
 
 Visit scheduling
 
 view of the
 
 Activities
 
 section), will have links to the knowledge base articles specified on the
 
 Attachments and notes
 
 detail.
