**Freedom UI Designer** 
 is a visual drag-and-drop editor that lets you create and set up a fully responsive app layout (including mobile). You can create UIs from ready layout templates, such as pages with tabs and dashboards. You can also create a custom UI of any structure from scratch. Set up the pages in the new Freedom UI framework, which lets you modify the appearance of elements, manage data sources, and place page components arbitrarily.
 



 Work in the Freedom UI Designer using no-code tools. UI design involves structuring the page with layout elements: tabs, areas, and columns. Depending on the information you want to display on the page, you can also set up charts, add fields, lists, buttons, and other components.
 





 Note.
 
 We recommend using Freedom UI Designer in Google Chrome instead of Safari to take full advantage of Freedom UI Designer capabilities.
 




 To begin with the setup of Freedom UI pages, click the
 ![btn_edit_page.png](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/btn_edit_page.png)
 button in the top right of the current app page →
 
 Edit page
 
 .
 



 This opens the Freedom UI Designer (Fig. 1).

**Element library (1)** 
 . The library contains the tools required to set up a custom UI.
 



**Action panel (2)** 
 . Use the action panel to save the page design, cancel the changes, set up the business rules, open the source code and page property settings.
 



**Canvas (3)** 
 . The working area of the Freedom UI Designer. Drag elements from the library to the canvas to set up the page structure.
 



**Setup area (4)** 
 . Use the setup area to manage the properties of visual components, the behavior of buttons, expansion panels, charts, etc. Learn more about the settings in the description of each element. To open the setup area, double-click the relevant element or select the element on the canvas and click .

 Data
------



 App pages can accept single or multiple data sources. For example, a data source for a record page is a specific object. Creatio adds a data source automatically when you create an app. You can add an existing source or create a new source when you add an app page.
 



 To add a new data source:
 


1. Click
 
 Add data source
 
 .
2. Select “New data source.” This opens a window.
3. Fill out the
 
 Name
 
 and
 
 Description
 
 fields of the data source in the window.



 As a result, Creatio will add an object and connect it to the page as a data source. The Freedom UI Designer will display the data source in the
 
 Data
 
 group. The
 
 Code
 
 field will be populated automatically (Fig. 2).
 




 Fig. 2 Data in the Freedom UI Designer
 

![designer_interfaces_new_source.png](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/designer_interfaces_new_source.png)



 You can display data and enable users to enter data using
 [fields](#title-2230-117) 
 and
 [inputs](#title-2230-27) 
 .
 


### 
 Fields



 Use fields to display data and enable users to enter data. When you set up fields, Creatio adds and modifies the corresponding attributes of the data model. After you set up a field and save the page, you can remove the field from the canvas without removing the corresponding attributes of the data model. To add existing fields to the page, drag them from the
 
 Data
 
 area to the relevant part of the canvas.
 



 Creatio specifies the data source automatically. You can change it in the
 
 Advanced
 
 section of the field setup area if needed. If the new data source is a different attribute of the page data model, the field on the canvas changes to the field bound to the specified attribute. If the new data source is an attribute of a related object, Freedom UI Designer converts the field to an input.
 



 You can add the following field types to the page in the UI Designer:
 


* Text
 
 . Enables users to enter letters, digits, and other characters.
* Number
 
 . Enables users to enter integers or fractions.
* Checkbox
 
 . Enables users to select either of the two values: “True” or “False.” “True” value is a selected checkbox.
* Date/Time
 
 . Enables users to select date and/or time, depending on the selected format.
* Rich text
 
 . Enables users to enter rich text content, including clickable links, images, and tables. For example, this is useful for writing comments or knowledge base articles.
* Phone
 
 . Enables users to enter phone numbers. Functionally identical to the “Phone number” format type of the text field. Can apply the phone number pattern. If Creatio is integrated with a phone service, users can click the phone number to initiate a call from the communication panel. Otherwise, clicking the field runs the application that handles phone calls.
* Email
 
 . Enables users to enter email addresses as clickable “mailto:” links that are opened by the default email client. Can validate the email address format.
* Web link
 
 . Enables users to enter clickable URLs.
* Dropdown
 
 . Enables users to select values from a set list of options stored in a lookup or other data source. You can add a new lookup object when you add this field.
* Color
 
 . Enables users to specify a color value. For example, this is useful for product pages.
* Autonumber
 
 . Numbers new records automatically starting from 1, both when a user adds a record and a business process or integration add it. You can set the number prefix and change the quantity of digits in the number. Creatio reserves the number when you click a button that adds records. When you click a button that adds records again, Creatio reserves the subsequent number, even if the previous record was not saved.
* Image
 
 . Enables users to upload or view images. Can display images from different sources, for example, Creatio database or CDN.



 The Freedom UI Designer supports various properties that provide flexible field setup options. Learn more about setting up fields in a separate guide:
 [Fields and inputs](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/user/nocode_platform/element_setup_examples/fields_and_inputs) 
 .
 




 Fig. 3
 
 Dropdown
 
 field
 

![](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/scr_dropdown_field.png)


### 
 Inputs



 Use
 
 Input
 
 layout elements to display data and enable users to enter data. When you set up inputs, Creatio does not modify the attributes of the data model.
 



 Specify the data source manually in the
 
 Advanced
 
 section of the input setup area. Inputs accept data from attributes of related objects. If you specify an attribute of the page data model, Freedom UI Designer converts the input on the canvas to a field.
 



 Input setup is mostly similar to the field setup. However, input setup does not modify the structure of the data model.
 



 The input types you can add correspond to field types except for the unique
 
 Slider
 
 input. It displays an integer within a range and enables users to slide the value up and down with a preset step value. Learn more about setting up the
 
 Slider
 
 in a separate article:
 [Set up a [Slider] input](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2442) 
 .

 Charts
--------



 Chart functionality in Freedom UI is mostly similar to
 [analytics](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2144) 
 in the
 
 Dashboard
 
 section of the main Creatio application. However, Freedom UI charts have some unique features:
 


* You can connect all charts except “Sales pipeline” and “Full pipeline” to lists, approval lists, or attachment lists. This filters chart data by records displayed in the connected component or the record selected in the list. For example, this lets you display data in case charts only for open cases.
 

 Fig. 5 Charts connected to a list
 

![](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/gif_charts_connected_to_list.gif)
* You can filter all charts except “Sales pipeline” and “Full pipeline” using the
 
 Quick filter
 
 component. For example, this lets you display data in case charts only for a particular agent.
 

 Fig. 6 Filtering charts using the quick lookup filter
 

![](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/gif_chart_lookup_filter.gif)
* When you drill down chart data, you can customize the data list similarly to a Freedom UI section list as well as search for specific records (Fig. 7). Learn more about customizing Freedom UI lists in a separate article:
 [Manage a list](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2402) 
 .
 

 Fig. 7 Drilling down chart data
 

![](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/gif_drill_down.gif)
* You can export chart and pivot table data to Excel to process data easier. To do this, expand the dashboard and select
 
 Export to Excel
 
 in the context menu. The browser will download the data file to your computer (Fig. 8).
 

 Fig. 8 Exporting chart data to Excel
 

![](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/updates/gif_export_to_excel.gif)
* For charts that have multiple series, you can customize the header color and series color individually. Use the
 
 Chart color
 
 and
 
 Style
 
 fields to do this, respectively (optional) (Fig. 9).
 

 Fig. 9 Setting up a chart that has several series
 



![page_wizard_set_dashboard.gif](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/set_home_page/page_wizard_set_dashboard.gif)
* You can select from several fill options in the
 
 Chart style
 
 field for “Metric” and “Chart” dashboard headings (Fig. 10).
 

 Fig. 10 Setting up the chart heading style
 

![set_up_dashboard_style.gif](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/set_home_page/set_up_dashboard_style.gif)
* The “Pie chart” type is replaced with the “Doughnut chart” type. Set up this chart similar to the pie chart (Fig. 11).
 

 Fig. 11 Doughnut chart
 

![dashboard_donut.png](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/set_home_page/dashboard_donut.png)
* You can filter chart and metric data by the parameters of their location page. Configure the filter in the
 
 How to associate with page data
 
 field group. The setup process is similar to the
 
 How to associate with section data
 
 field group. For example, you can set up a budget composition chart on a request page and limit the chart data to the request whose page the user opens.
* You can specify whether to display values of individual bars and columns on “Bar” and “Column” chart types, respectively.



 Components
------------


### 
 Button



 Use the
 
 Button
 
 component to execute a page action. The following actions are available:
 


* **Open new record** 
 . Opens the form page of a new record that belongs to any Creatio object. You can create and edit the form page for any Creatio object as part of the button setup. It is possible to set different form pages for new records and existing records, for example, a mini page and full page, respectively. If different record types use different pages, for example,
 
 Activities
 
 section, you can specify the page to open.
 



 The action can also populate the form page fields with specific values if needed.
* **Delete data** 
 . Deletes selected records from the
 
 List
 
 component that has multiselect turned on.
* **Open existing record** 
 . Opens the form page of a specific record that belongs to any Creatio object. You can create and edit the form page for any Creatio object as part of the button setup. It is possible to set different form pages for new records and existing records, for example, a mini page and full page, respectively. If different record types use different pages, for example, the
 
 Activities
 
 section, you can specify the page to open.
* **Open specific page** 
 . Opens any Freedom UI page, including list pages, mini pages, and homepages. You can create and edit the page to open as part of the button setup.

### 
 List



 Use the
 
 List
 
 component to add a list of the selected object’s data based on pre-configured filters.
 



 You can connect lists to other page components that work with data. This includes approval lists, attachment lists, other lists, or charts except “Sales pipeline” and “Full pipeline.” The connected components filter their data by records displayed in the list. For example, this lets you filter the list of cases by the list of displayed agents. Components can be linked via direct connection, for example, the city of a contact. If you connect a list to another list, you can also filter data by the record selected in the list.
 



 Users can add, hide, freeze, and resize list columns while working in an app. Creatio saves the list settings in the user profile, therefore the settings are applied every time an app is opened. It is also possible to apply list settings to every app user. Restore the default settings in a single click via the
 
 Reset to default settings
 
 button. Learn more about managing lists in a separate article:

 Layout elements
-----------------


### 
 Expansion panel



 Use the
 
 Expansion panel
 
 layout element to add page elements grouped by a single criterion. You can attach any elements available in the Freedom UI Designer to the expansion panel title or the area within the expansion panel. Learn more about setting up expansion panels in a separate article:
 [Set up an [Expansion panel] layout element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2437) 
 .
 



 You can customize the internal layout of the expansion panel: column number, background color, spacing, etc. To do this, select the area within the expansion panel and click the
 ![btn_properties.png](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/btn_properties.png)
 button. The customization is similar to the
 
 Grid container
 
 layout element. Learn more about setting up grid containers in a separate article:
 [Set up a [Grid container] layout element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2439)

### 
 Tabs



 Use the
 
 Tabs
 
 layout element to add a tab area to the page. The area lets you display content grouped by multiple criteria. That way, you can publish more required information without overcrowding the page. You can reorder tabs and attach any elements available in the Freedom UI Designer to tabs, including other tabs. To do this, drag the tab to the needed position. Learn more about setting up tabs in a separate article:
 [Set up a [Tabs] layout element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2438) 
 .
 



 You can customize the internal layout of each tab: column number, background color, spacing, etc. To do this, select the area within a tab and click the
 ![btn_properties.png](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/designer_interfaces/btn_properties.png)
 button. The customization is similar to the
 
 Grid container
 
 layout element. Learn more about setting up grid containers in a separate article:

### 
 Toggle panel



 Use the
 
 Toggle panel
 
 layout element to add a tab area to the page. Compared to the similar
 
 Tabs
 
 element, toggle panel has the following unique features that let you create more advanced page functionality:
 


* Toggle panel is controlled by buttons you can place anywhere on the page.
* You can click the active tab button to hide the panel. Click any tab button to display the panel again. The panel is hidden by default.



 This lets you save more workspace by placing elements that are usually only needed on demand, such as a feed or attachment list.
 



 The element setup process is similar to the
 
 Tabs
 
 layout element. Learn more about setting up tabs in a separate article:
 [Set up a [Tabs] layout element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2438) 
 .

### 
 Area and columns




 Area
 
 and
 
 Columns
 
 layout elements are different configuration options of the
 
 Grid container
 
 element. Grid containers have a fixed layout that can contain up to 12 columns. You can attach any Freedom UI element to a grid container, including other grid containers.
 



 Areas let you divide the page visually into multiple sections. Use areas to add page blocks that group any combination of other elements. For example, fields, charts, buttons, and other areas. Use columns to change layout parameters for areas, expansion panels, or tabs flexibly as well as arrange page content vertically.

### 
 Flex container



 Use flex containers to group elements in a certain direction without binding the elements to a fixed layout. For example, flex containers are a convenient option for button placement.
 



 The Freedom UI Designer includes the following flex container types:
 


* **Flex row** 
 . Lets you place elements horizontally. For example, buttons.
* **Flex column** 
 . Lets you place as many elements as needed vertically.



 To transform a flex row into a flex column and vice versa, click the corresponding buttons in the
 
 Direction
 
 block of the setup area. Learn more about setting up flex containers in a separate article:
 [Set up a [Flex container] layout element](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2440)
