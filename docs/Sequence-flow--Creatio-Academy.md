 Sequence Flow is used to define the order of execution for actions. For example, a contract must be approved and then signed by the parties (Fig. 1).

 Moving down the sequence flow is performed after the source process element is completed.
 



 Any process element can have more than one outgoing sequence flow. In this case, moving down all outgoing flows is simultaneous. Using multiple outgoing sequence flows is equal to using a
 [parallel gateway](/docs/7-18/user/bpm_tools/process_elements_reference/gateways/parallel_gateway_and/parallel_gateway_and_process_element) 
 .
