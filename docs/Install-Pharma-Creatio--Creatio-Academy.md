 Pharma Creatio functionality is designed to efficiently schedule the med reps' visits to doctors and pharmacies, build routes on the map, manage the visit activities and assist med reps during the visits.
 





 Attention.
 
 This function is unavailable for the Oracle DBMS.
 




**Use a mobile device** 
 with the Creatio application installed during your visits. After selecting the required visit in the calendar, you will be transferred to the visit page, which will display the visit action list and switches for each action.
 



 During a visit, the system will prompt the required steps. For example, when performing the
 
 Presentation
 
 action, the screen will automatically display a presentation of new products, etc.
 



 During a visit, you can add orders based on visit results, create a list of products and their number and write down stock keeping unit (SKU) monitoring results and product facing check results.
