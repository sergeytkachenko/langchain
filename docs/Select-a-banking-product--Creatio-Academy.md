 Creatio product selection enables the customer assistant to find products from the catalog that meet the customer’s needs and submit product applications on behalf of contacts or legal entities. You can use Creatio product selection in any business logic. Learn more:
 [Set up a product selection process](/docs/8-0/user/finance_and_banking/financial_products/product_selection_finance/example_process/set_up_a_product_selection_business_process)

 Creatio displays only the available products on the product selection page.
