 The
 
 Predict data
 
 process element uses trained machine learning (ML) models to predict data for records as part of a business process.
 



 Specify a previsouly created ML model to predict data and select records for prediction.
 





 Note.
 
 Prediction models have to be trained before they can be used in the business process. If the model is not trained, it will not be available for selection in the
 
 Predict data
 
 element. Read more:
