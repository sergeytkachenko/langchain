 This tab is available by default in the following sections:
 


* Contacts
* Accounts
* Leads
* Opportunities
* Cases
 
 .

 Note.

 The timeline displays linked records in chronological order. The following types of records are displayed on the timeline:
 


* tasks
* calls
* emails
* feed messages
* files
* links
* contracts
* documents
* projects.



 In some sections, the timeline displays additional types of records. The timeline content is determined by the Creatio product and section specifics. For example, in bank products, the history of the customer's cases, invoices, and cards is also displayed in the timeline.

 The records on the

 Depending on the text volume, the list records may be displayed in a “collapsed” view mode. You can expand a collapsed record by clicking the
