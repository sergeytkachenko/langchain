 You can set up workplaces in the Mobile Wizard. The Mobile Wizard enables you:
 


* To view the list of available workplaces.
* To add new workplaces.
* To change the settings of the existing workplaces.



 By default, the mobile application has a single “primary” workplace. As a rule, mobile app workplaces are configured by Creatio administrators.
 



 Installing Creatio marketplace extensions (e.g., Field Sales) may add more workplaces.
