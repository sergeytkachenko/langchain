 Your personal cloud key and the URL to Creatio cloud services are required to use data enrichment. Use the following system settings to specify these values:
 


* ”Account enrichment service URL”. By default, this setting is populated for all applications.
* “Creatio cloud services API key”. This setting is populated for
 **cloud** 
 applications by default but needs to be configured for
 **on-site** 
 applications.



 Request your personal key for your
 **on-site** 
 application from the Creatio support. After receiving the key:
 


1. In the system designer, click the
 
 System settings
 
 link.
2. Go to the
 
 Creatio cloud services
 
 group, and select the
 
 Creatio cloud services API key
 
 system setting.
3. Specify the key in the
 
 Default value
 
 field and click
 
 Save
 




 Data enrichment functions can now be used.
