 The sets of sections displayed on the Creatio side panel for different user groups (roles) are called workplaces. You can set up any workplace by creating a list of sections that are necessary for the users in their everyday work. The sections that are not included in it will be hidden from the main application menu.
 



 The list of available workplaces may vary depending on the user group. For example, a
 
 Communications
 
 workplace may include
 
 Activities
 
 ,
 
 Calls
 
 and
 
 Feed
 
 sections to be available for all system users, and a
 
 Supervisor
 
 workplace may include administration sections for users and roles that should be available for the system administrators group only.
 



 Access to the workplaces does not affect the access to the system. The full set of Creatio sections, including the sections not included in any workplace, will still be available on the application home page.
