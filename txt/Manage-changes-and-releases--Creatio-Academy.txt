 Creatio implements the "Change management" ITSM process in the
 
 Changes
 
 and
 
 Releases
 
 sections.
 



 Use the
 
 Changes
 
 section to register all changes emerging from the IT infrastructure and affecting the provided services. You can also classify the changes by source or goal, track changes implementation,  and define the final information about actual working hours.
 



 Use the
 
 Releases
 
 section to plan the implementation of changes to your IT infrastructure.
 





 Plan changes
----------------



 In Creatio, you register changes to resolve the
 
[problems](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=service%20enterprise&ver=7&id=1064) 

 identified as part of the problem management process. When making changes in the IT infrastructure, it is vital to adequately estimate all possible risks. Making a change to an item in the infrastructure may affect the availability of other configuration items and services.
 



 Relationships and interdependencies between services and configuration items form a common
 
[service model](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=service%20enterprise&ver=7&id=1276) 

 , which enables analyzing possible consequences of changes to any of the IT infrastructure components.
 



 To plan the changes to the IT infrastructure, add a record to the

 Determine the scope of a change
-----------------------------------



 Use the
 
 Display dependencies
 
 action on a service or configuration item page to view the IT infrastructure items that may be affected by the change:
 


1. Go to the
 
 Changes
 
 section and open the needed record.
2. Select the configuration item or service in the corresponding detail on the
 
 Classification
 
 tab.
3. Select the
 
 Show dependencies
 
 action from the menu of the corresponding detail (
 [Fig. 1](#XREF_31830_99)
 ).
 





 Fig. 1
 

 Displaying dependencies for a configuration item of a change record
 

![scr_section_changes_display_connections.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_changes_releases/scr_section_changes_display_connections.png)



 The service model diagram will open displaying the dependency connections for the configuration item or service (
 [Fig. 2](#XREF_33372_100)
 ).

 Service model connections view for changes
 

![scr_section_changes_srm_display.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_changes_releases/scr_section_changes_srm_display.png)



 The diagram displays all incoming and outgoing dependencies of the selected configuration item or service. The item at the center of the diagram represents the current configuration item or service. The influencer services and configuration items are to the left, the depending ones are to the right. For example, the diagram (
 [Fig. 3](#XREF_83561_101)
 ) shows that the switchboard depends on the server, while the “PBX setup” and “Internal phone number setup” services depend on the switchboard.
 





 Fig. 3
 

 Configuration item connections example
 

![scr_section_changes_srm_schema.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_changes_releases/scr_section_changes_srm_schema.png)



 In this case, when planning a change to the switchboard configuration item, you can easily see which depending services (i.e. “PBX setup” and “Internal phone number setup”) and configuration items (i.e. “IP phone”) may be affected.
 





 Note.
