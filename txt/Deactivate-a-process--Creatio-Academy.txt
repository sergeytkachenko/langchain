 Note.
 
 If you are deactivating a process that has uncompleted instances, the system will warn you. If you choose to deactivate such a process, all running instances of the process will be canceled.
 




 The
 
 Active
 
 checkbox on the process settings page will also be cleared. Deactivated processes are not displayed in the menu and cannot be run from the command line. If the deactivated business process is used as a sub-process in other processes, the
 
 Active
 
 checkbox value will be ignored.
 



 Select the needed record in the process library list and run the
 
 Deactivate process
 
 action to deactivate a business process.
