 Connect your Google Ads account to Creatio to sync your Google ads in Creatio. Once you connect your account, Creatio will import data of all ad campaigns in that account and generate analytics.
 



 Before you connect the account, make sure the Google Ads user has
 **publish access to the ad tool** 
 and
 **administrator access for the individual account** 
 .
 



 Connect the Google Ads account
--------------------------------


1. **Open** 
 the
 
 Ad campaigns
 
 section.
2. **Click** 

 Ad accounts
 
 in the top right.
3. **Click** 

 Connect account
 
 in the “Google” group. This opens a window. If the window does not open, allow pop-ups in your browser.
4. **Sign in** 
 to the relevant Google account.
5. **Grant all permissions** 
 to Creatio. These permissions are required for the integration to operate as intended.
6. Click
 
 Connect
 
 .



**As a result** 
 , Creatio will connect the Google Ads account. The synchronization might take some time depending on the amount of data.
 



 Google will share information about all ad campaigns in the connected ad accounts. For example, name, budget, impressions, clicks. You can connect the Google Ads account to other Creatio instances if needed. For example, to test customizations.
