 The contact center or support team supervisor can use the
 
 Queues
 
 section to control the queue elements handling.
 



 Here you can view all cases and other queue elements:
 


* You can monitor the work of the contact center on-line.
 
[When monitoring the content of all queues](#HT_section_supervisor_view_queue_items) 

 in one list, a contact center supervisor can view the number of cases or outgoing calls or elements that are already in progress.
* [Track the performance of specific queues](#HT_section_supervisor_filter_by_queue) 

 and
 
[control the workload of particular agents](#HT_section_supervisor_filter_by_agent) 

 using the quick filters.
* Due to the similar
 
[queue element sorting](#HT_section_supervisor_sorting) 

 , as well as on the agent desktop agent page, the supervisor can identify which queue elements are going to be processed.
* Distribute the current workload between the agents
 
[by assigning the agents to specific queue elements](#HT_section_supervisor_act_assign_agent) 

 . Involve additional agents to work with the queues. Delegate cases from one agent to the other or cancel handling the case by a particular agent.
* Join the contact center team:

 take cases and other queue elements, return the elements that were closed incorrectly back to the corresponding queues, manually close the queue elements that do not require processing.





 Note.
 
 Any user who has access to the
 
 Queues
 
 section can perform all operations as the contact center manager.
 





 Monitor contact center performance
-------------------------------------



 The key element of agent workflow management is the ability to monitor the total workload of the contact center. When monitoring all outgoing calls and incoming cases in a single list, the supervisor can quickly identify the cases that require attention.
 



 Use the
 
 Queues
 
 section to view all incoming cases, contacts, and accounts in a single list if they were added to the
 
[static queues](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=studio&ver=7&id=802) 

 or are within the
 
[dynamic queues](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=administration&ver=7&id=801) 

 according to the filter settings.
 



 The list displays key information about the queue content. You can manage the information displayed using the standard
 
 View
 
 menu >
 
 Select fields to display
 
 menu.
 





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
 Queue
  | 
 The queue to which the element belongs. Click the queue name to open the setup page of the current queue.
  |
| 
 Agent
  | 
 The agent who processed the queue element or was assigned by the contact center manager to handle the queue element.
  |
| 
 Status
  | 
 Current status of the element in a queue:
 

 "Not processed" – the agent has not started working with the element. Assigning the agent does not change the status of the element in the queue.
 

 "In progress" – the agent has started working on the element by clicking the
 
 Take it
 
 button.
 

 "Processed" – the agent has finished working with this element. The elements in this status are not displayed unless the
 
 Show processed
 
 checkbox is checked.
  |
| 
 Date of next handling
  | 
 The field displays the date when this element is scheduled for processing if the agent postponed the processing of this element.
  |
| 
 Number of postponements
  | 
 The number of times the element was returned to the queue by clicking the
 
 Back to queue
 
 button.
  |
| 
 Case,
 

 Account,
 

 Contact, etc.
  | 
 The main fields of the queue object. The “primary display columns” of the queue object. The primary display column contains the case number for the "Cases" queue object or the contact full name for the "Contact" queue object. If you add other objects to the
 
 Queue objects
 
 lookup, their primary display columns will be displayed in this field too.
 

 Click the queue element name to open the corresponding record page.
  |






 Note.
 

[Customize columns](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=1231) 

 to display fields of queue objects in the list. For example, you can add the
 
 Case subject
 
 field to the list of the
 
 Queues
 
 section.
 




 The
 
 Queues
 
 section displays information about queue elements that are being processed, elements that were taken by an agent and postponed, and those that were not taken. When sorting elements by the
 
 Agent
 
 or
 
 Status
 
 column, the contact center manager can view the current status of the operations.
 




 Manage progress on specific queues
-------------------------------------



 To monitor the progress of particular queues, the contact center manager can quickly display data for particular queues. For example, the queues filter can be used to analyze calls to customers for one or several product promotions.
 



 To view particular queue items, filter the records using the
 
 Queue
 
 filter:
 


1. Go to the
 
 Queues
 
 section.
2. In the
 
 Queues
 
 view, click
 
 Queue
 
 and select the
 
 Add queue
 
 option.
3. Select the required queue in the opened lookup.
 



 The selected queue will be added to the filter conditions. The content of this queue will be displayed in the list. If you add multiple queues to the filter, all elements from the selected queues will be displayed.



 You can view the progress for specific queues by displaying the total number of their elements. To view the queue elements:
 


1. In the
 
 View
 
 menu, select the
 
 Set up summaries
 
 command.
2. Select the
 
 Display number of records
 
 checkbox.



 To display processed elements, select the
 
 Show processed
 
 checkbox. Only processed elements from the selected queues will be displayed in the list, for example, closed cases or completed calls.
 



 To view which queue elements are in the process, sort the elements by
 
 Agent
 
 or
 
 Status
 
 column.
 




 Manage current workload of an agent
--------------------------------------



 To view the current workload of an agent, filter the elements by the agent in the
 
 Queues
 
 section. The filter enables you to view the current workload for one or several agents regardless of which queues they work with.
 



 To filter the case by an agent:
 


1. Go to the
 
 Queues
 
 section.
2. Select the
 
 Add agent
 
 option from the
 
 Agent
 
 filter.
3. Select the required agent in the opened lookup.
 



 The list will display queue elements that are being processed by the selected agent and those elements assigned to that particular agent. If you add several agents to the filter, the list will display queue elements processed by all of the selected agents.
4. To view processed cases, check the
 
 Show processed
 
 checkbox.
 



 As a result, processed queue elements, such as closed cases, will be displayed in the list. for example, the cases with the "Closed" status.



 The contact center manager can then monitor which cases the agent is currently processing and which the agent has already processed.
 




 Plan agent workload
----------------------



 To plan which queue elements will be processed next by the agents, display the items from the selected queues in the same order as they are shown on the agent desktop To do this:
 


1. Go to the
 
 Queues
 
 section.
2. Use the queue filter to display the required elements in the list.
3. Select the
 
 Agent view
 
 checkbox.



 The queue elements will be displayed in the same order as they are shown on the agent desktop As a result, the contact center manager can view the order in which the elements will be processed.
 



 If the
 
 Agent view
 
 checkbox is selected, the list in the
 
 Queues
 
 section will display all elements from the blind queues and in the order in which they will be processed.
 




 Assign agents
----------------



 The contact center manager can assign and reassign agents manually or cancel low priority elements.
 



 To assign agents:
 


1. Go to the
 
 Queues
 
 section.
2. Select the queue element that must be assigned to a particular agent in the list.
3. Select the
 
 Assign agent
 
 option from the
 
 Actions
 
 menu.
4. Select an agent from the list.
 



 The selected agent will be assigned to the queue element. The elements assigned to the agent will be displayed on the agent desktop for this particular agent even if the agent is not included in the team of the corresponding queue. After assigning the agent, the item will not be displayed on the agent desktop for other agents.



 To cancel the assignment:
 


1. Go to the
 
 Queues
 
 section.
2. Select the element that has been assigned to an agent.
3. Select the
 
 Clear agent
 
 option from the
 
 Actions
 
 menu.
 



 The selected element will be returned to the queue and becomes available for an agent who is included in the corresponding queue team.
