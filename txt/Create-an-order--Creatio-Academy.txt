 In Creatio, you can add installment plans, product lists, discounts and other data.
 



 To do this:
 


1. Open the
 
 Orders
 
 section.
2. Click
 
 New order
 
 .
3. On the page that opens, specify the order recipient in the
 
 Customer
 
 required field. In the field, you can select a value from the existing contacts and accounts.
4. Go to the
 
 Products
 
 detail and add a list of goods and services included in the order. There are several methods of doing this:
 


	1. Click
	 ![btn_com_add_tab.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/short_sales/BPMonlineHelp/short_sales_create_order/btn_com_add_tab.png)

	 ![btn_detail_menu.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/short_sales/BPMonlineHelp/short_sales_create_order/btn_detail_menu.png)
	 button →
	 
	 Add
	 
	 .
	 
	
	
	
	 If necessary, add a discount on specific products in the
	 
	 Discount,%
	 
	 field. Learn more in the “
	 
	[Add products to an invoice or an order](/docs/8-0/user/sales_tools/short_sales_orders_and_invoices/add_products/add_products_to_an_invoice_or_an_order#HT_specs_orders_product_selection) 
	
	 ” article.
	 
	
	
	
	 As a result, the total cost of the order will be calculated in the
	 
	 Amount
	 
	 column.
5. Go to the
 
 Order details
 
 tab and add an order installment plan. You can populate the installment plan either manually or via a template. Learn more in the “
 
[Add an order installment plan](/docs/8-0/user/sales_tools/short_sales_orders_and_invoices/installment_plan/add_an_order_installment_plan#HT_specs_orders_products_page) 

 ” article.
6. You can submit orders for approval to other Creatio users (e.g., approve order amount with managers) using the standard approval function. To do this, use the
 
 Send for approval
 
 action on the order page. The action opens an additional page, where you can select an employee that the document is sent to, and set other approval parameters.  More information about this feature is available in the “
 
[Approvals](/docs/8-0/user/platform_basics/communications/approvals_shortcut/approvals) 

 ” article.
 



 After adding any data to any detail, the order will be autosaved. The order number is generated automatically in accordance with the “Order number mask” system setting (OrderCodeMask).
