 The Field Module for Creatio add-on can automate field staff tasks.
 



 This lets you:
 


* Plan field staff meetings (“visits”).
* Build optimal routes between the meeting locations on the map.
* Maintain the visit agenda and guidelines.
* Keep a record of the employee’s activities during the visit.
* Create custom visit agenda and guidelines.



 Field staff uses Creatio mobile app in the field to record the meeting time frame and conduct presentations during a visit. Field Module for Creatio is fully compatible with all Creatio products. Use it as a framework for custom field apps. For example, field banking or field service.
