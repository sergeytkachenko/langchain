 Streamline Creatio customization by adding translations to UI elements, such as fields, field groups, details, and tabs, while setting up these elements in the Section Wizard. For example, here is how you can add the
 **field title** 
 translation.
 


1. Open the relevant section, e. g.,
 
 Requests
 
 .
2. Click
 
 View
 
 →
 
 Open section wizard
 
 .
3. In the “Section pages” block of the Section Wizard:
	* click
	 
	 Edit page
	 
	 if there is a single page in the section
	* click
	 **the link to the relevant page** 
	 if there are several pages in the section.
4. Select a field you need to translate and click
 ![btn_section_wizard_column_edit.png](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/set_page_fields/btn_section_wizard_column_edit.png)
 . If there is no such field, add it.
5. In the setup window:

	 ![set_title_field_localization.png](/docs/sites/en/files/images/NoCode_Customization/set_page_fields/set_title_field_localization.png)

	 Title on page
	 
	 and
	 
	 Tooltip
	 
	 fields.
