 Connect your Facebook Ads account to Creatio to sync your Facebook ads with Creatio. Once you connect the account, Creatio will import data of all ad campaigns in that account and generate analytics.
 



 Before you connect the account, make sure the Facebook Ads user has
 **publish access to the ad tool** 
 and
 **is an administrator of the ad account in Business Manager** 
 .
 



 Connect the Facebook Ads account
----------------------------------


1. **Open** 
 the
 
 Ad campaigns
 
 section.
2. **Click** 

 Ad accounts
 
 in the top right.
3. **Click** 

 Connect account
 
 in the “Facebook” group. This opens a window. If the window does not open, allow pop-ups in your browser.
4. **Log in** 
 to the relevant Facebook account.
5. **Grant all permissions** 
 to Creatio. These permissions are required for the integration to operate as intended.
6. **Select the business account** 
 to connect to Creatio →
 
 Connect
 
 .



**As a result** 
 , Creatio will connect your Facebook Ads account. The synchronization might take some time depending on the amount of data.
 



 Facebook will share information about all ad campaigns in the connected accounts. For example, name, budget, impressions, clicks. You can connect the Facebook Ads account to other Creatio instances if needed. For example, to test customizations.
