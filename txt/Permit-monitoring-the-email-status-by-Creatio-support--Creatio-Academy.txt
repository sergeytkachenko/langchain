 We recommend that you set up monitoring of your email status by the support service before you start working with emails. If you do this, Creatio support will be able to resolve any potential bulk email issues faster. Support service employees will have access to aggregated bulk email metrics that do not contain personalized email message texts, email templates, etc.
 



 The procedure is different for cloud and on-site applications.
 



**Instructions for on-site applications** 
 are available in the

**Instructions for cloud applications** 
 are as follows:
 


1. Open the system designer by clicking the
