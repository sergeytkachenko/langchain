 Moving down a default flow is done when it is impossible to move down any of the conditional flows. For example, by default products are sold to the customer at a standard price, but for large orders the customer can get a discount (Fig. 1).

 A default flow is used when there is at least one conditional flow outgoing from the same process element.
 



 As a rule, source process elements for a default flow are gateways, but activities can be used as well.
