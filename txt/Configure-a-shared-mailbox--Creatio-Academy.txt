 Shared email account enables managing shared access to the mailbox: set the access permissions to read emails for different groups of users, enable processing of incoming emails and sending emails from one address for different users or groups of users.
 



 Shared mailboxes are commonly used:
 


* For case registration, sending notifications and emailing between the customers and the service team in the process of case resolution or for processing requests about company products.
* For processing information requests about company products. For example, you can create a shared sales department mailbox and grant access to the advertising department employees for sending newsletters and special offers.





 Note.
 
 All incoming and outgoing emails from the shared mailbox, will only be visible in the communication panel, timeline and history to the user who registered this mailbox in Creatio and to the users which get the access permission to work with emails.
 






 Attention.
 
 To set up a shared mailbox, you need permission to perform the
 
 Access to shared account setup
 
 and
 
 Shared mailbox synchronization setup
 
 system operations.
 [Managing access to system operations](https://academy.creatio.com/docs/documents?ver=7&id=258)

	 From
	 
	 field when sending emails, setting up business processes and display incoming emails at the communication panel.
