 Creatio
 [mobile app](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=mobile&ver=7&id=1388) 
 uses
 [push notifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology) 
 to display custom notifications on mobile devices. These “push notifications” are generated by a pre-configured “Send push notifications” BPMN process. Use it as a
 [sub-process](/docs/7-18/user/bpm_tools/process_elements_reference/sub_processes/sub_process/sub_process_element) 
 to integrate push notifications in your custom processes and cases.
 





 Example.
 
 Create a business process that will send a push notification to mobile app users once they are added to activities as participants. The notification message displays the name of the activity and text “You have been added as participant”. By tapping the notification, the user opens the corresponding activity record.
 




 Business process diagram (Fig. 1) elements:
 


1. [Signal](/docs/7-18/user/bpm_tools/process_elements_reference/events/signal/signal_start_event)
 start event: “Activity participant added” – the process is triggered when a contact is added to activity participants.
2. [Read data](/docs/7-18/user/bpm_tools/process_elements_reference/system_actions/read_data/read_data_process_element)
 system action: “Read activity participant data” – the process obtains activity participant data needed to perform the next steps.
3. [Read data](/docs/7-18/user/bpm_tools/process_elements_reference/system_actions/read_data/read_data_process_element)
 system action: “Read system administration object data” – based on the activity participant data, the process obtains information on the user whose contact was added to activity participants.
4. [Read data](/docs/7-18/user/bpm_tools/process_elements_reference/system_actions/read_data/read_data_process_element)
 system action: “Read activity data” – based on the activity participant data, the process obtains information on the activity record. Outgoing
 [conditional flow](/docs/7-18/user/bpm_tools/process_elements_reference/flows/sequence_flow_shortcut/sequence_flow) 
 to the terminate element that will end the process if the activity participant is the same as the activity author (to avoid sending push notification to the activity author). Outgoing default flow to the “Send push notification” sub-process.
5. [Sub-process](/docs/7-18/user/bpm_tools/process_elements_reference/sub_processes/sub_process/sub_process_element) 
 : “Send push notification” – the process sends push notification to the specified user with the specified text.

 To configure the process:
 


1. Place the
 
 Signal
 
 element of the
 
 Initial events
 
 group on the schema — "Activity participant added". The element will be activated when a contact is added on the
 
 Participants
 
 detail of the activity.
2. Set up the signal parameters:
	1. In the
	 
	 Which type of signal is received?
	 
	 field, select “Object signal”.
	2. In the
	 
	 Object
	 
	 field, select “Activity participant”.
	3. In the
	 
	 Which event should trigger the signal
	 
	 field, select “Record added”.
	 
	
	
	
	
	 The “Activity participant added” element properties (Fig. 2):

![scr_process_creation_push_read_data.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/scr_process_creation_push_read_data.png)


	1. In the
	 
	 Which data read mode to use?
	 
	 field, select “Read the first record in the selection”.
	2. In the
	 
	 Which object to read data from?
	 
	 field, select “Activity participant”.
	3. Set up the following filter in the
	 
	 How to filter records?
	 
	 area: “Id = Activity participant added.Unique identifier of record”.
	 
	
	
	
	
	
	 Note.
	 
	 To set the “Id = Activity participant added.Record Id” filter: click
	 
	 Add condition
	 
	 , select the
	 
	 Id
	 
	 column; click
	 
	 <?>
	 
	 and select
	 
	 Compare with parameter
	 
	 command; select the “Activity participant added” signal in the list to the left, and select the “Id” column in the list to the right.
	4. In the
	 
	 What record data should the process read?
	 
	 field, select “Read data from selected columns only”.
	5. Add the “Activity” and “Participant” columns (only these two columns from the activity participant record will be used further in the process).
	 
	
	
	
	
	
	 Note.
	 
	 We recommend to restrict the list of columns, whose values are read by the
	 
	 Read data
	 
	 elements, to those used in the process. This will increase the overall Creatio performance and lower the hardware load in applications with many processes in progress.
4. Set up the “Read system administration object data” element properties (Fig. 4):

8. Set up the “Send push notification” sub-process to send notification to the user that was selected by the “Read system administration object data” element.
	1. In the
	 
	 Related entity
	 
	 parameter, click
	 ![btn_process_element_settings_lookup00018.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_process_element_settings_lookup00018.png)
	 and select
	 
	 Lookup value
	 
	 . In the lookup window, select the “Activity” object.
	2. In the
	 
	 Related record ID
	 
	 parameter, click
	 ![btn_process_element_settings_lookup00019.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/bpms/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_process_creation_end/btn_process_element_settings_lookup00019.png)
	 and select
	 
	 Process parameter
	 
	 . In the
	 
	 Select parameter
	 
	 window, click the “Read activity participant data” in the list to the left and select
	 
	 Activity
	 
	 column to the right.
	 
	
	
	
	
	
	 Note.
	 
	 The
	 
	 Related entity
	 
	 (EntityUID) and
	 
	 Related record ID
	 
	 (RecordId) parameters of the “Send push notification” sub-process determine which record page will open when the user taps the push notification on their mobile device. For example, to open the activity page, we selected the “Activity” object as the value of the
	 
	 Related entity
	 
	 parameter, and mapped the
	 
	 Related record ID
	 
	 to the unique identifier of the activity record to open.
	   
	
	 The
	 
	 Related entity
	 
	 (EntityUID) and
	 
	 Related record ID
	 
	 (RecordId) parameters are optional. If they are left empty, tapping a push notification will simply open Creatio mobile app.
	 
	
	
	
	
	 As a result, when the business process is run, a push notification will be sent to the user, whose contact was added as the activity participant (Fig. 8).
