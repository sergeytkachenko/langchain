 The
 
 Activities
 
 section in the mobile application is synchronized with the primary Creatio application and can be used both offline and online (
 [Fig. 1](#XREF_92124_218)
 ).
 



 Tasks can be displayed either as a virtual organizer or a drop-down list. In the
 **calendar** 
 mode the tasks which you are responsible for, and those in which you were added to
 
 Participants
 
 detail, are displayed. In the
 **list** 
 mode, only the tasks for which you are responsible are displayed. You can select the view (drop-down list or calendar) in the upper area of the workspace area.

![scr_activity_period_button.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/mobile_app/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_mobile_activity_section/scr_activity_period_button.png)




 and select the required time interval.
 



 Tap anywhere on the blank calendar space and swipe right to go to the next day or left to go to the previous day.
 





 Note.
 
 The calendar view period can differ due to the work limitations of different mobile devices. For tablets: the schedule in the
 
 Activities
 
 section can be changed to weekly or daily mode. For mobile phones, the schedule is always displayed daily in portrait view and weekly in landscape view.
 




 The current time is indicated with an orange line.
 



 In the calendar area, all activities are displayed as rectangular blocks whose height corresponds to the duration of the activity.
 



 On the left side of the calendar area, time intervals are displayed.
 



 Activities in the calendar view are highlighted with different colors depending on their status and due date.
 


* Activities are highlighted in red when their due time has already passed and are not in the final state yet.
* Activities are highlighted blue when their due time hasn't passed and are not in the final state yet (scheduled or in progress)
* Grey is used to highlighting activities that are in the final state (completed or canceled).
