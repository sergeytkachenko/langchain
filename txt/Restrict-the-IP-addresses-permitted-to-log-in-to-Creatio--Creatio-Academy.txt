 Access restrictions to specific IP addresses for some Creatio users can be a part of your company's privacy policies for working with sensitive content. You can apply these restrictions to individual users or user roles. For example, you can restrict your financial department to IP addresses you use in your local network. This way these employees will be able to login to Creatio only from the office.
 



 The restriction setup procedure consists of multiple steps:
 


1. Set up IP address restrictions in configuration files.

2. Set up restrictions for users or roles.
 [Read more >>>](#title-2637-2)
3. Set up operations permissions.

 Set up operation permissions
------------------------------


1. Click
 ![btn_system_designer.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/system_operation_permissions/btn_system_designer.png)
 → System Designer →
 **Operation permissions**
2. Apply the “Name = Ignore access check by IP address” (or “Code = SuppressIPRestriction”) filter.
 **Click the operation name** 
 to open the operation.
3. Click
 ![btn_mobile_add_product.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/user_access_management/BPMonlineHelp/system_operation_permissions/btn_mobile_add_product.png)
 and specify the necessary
 **user/role** 
 on the
 
 Operation permission
 
 detail. For example the “Finance” organizational role. The user/role will show up on the
 
 Operation permission
 
 detail with the “NO” value in the “Access level” column.



 As a result, employees that have the “Finance” role will not be able to log in to Creatio outside of the permitted range of IP addresses.
