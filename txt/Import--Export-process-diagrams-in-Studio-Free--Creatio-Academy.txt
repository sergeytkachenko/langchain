 You can create a new business process diagram by importing a \*.bpmn file. You can also export any business process in Studio Creatio, free edition as a \*.bpmn file, or a \*.svg or \*.png image.
 





 Note.
 
 A \*.bpmn file is an XML document, describing a BPMN diagram. The XML structure corresponds to the one documented in
 
[BPMN 2.0.2 specification](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/) 

 . This universal format is supported by most business process editors and is perfect for migrating BPMN processes between different systems.
 




 Import a \*.BPMN file
-----------------------



 There are several ways you can import a business process from a \*.bpmn file.

 on the Process Designer working area.

 Business process diagrams that you export from Studio Creatio, free edition to a \*.bpmn file can be imported to Studio Creatio, enterprise edition, and other Creatio apps. The imported diagram will become an “executable” business process, which will execute automatic activities and interact with users.
