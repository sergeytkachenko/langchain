 Information about a doctor’s potential significance in terms of pharmacy product promotion is critical for choosing a proper communication strategy with the doctors. In Creatio, this information is available on the doctor’s contact page, in the
 
 Potential
 
 ,
 
 Loyalty
 
 and
 
 Category
 
 fields.
 



 The
 
 Potential
 
 field contains doctor’s estimated potential, which is an indicator of doctor’s capability to promote pharmacy products. The doctor’s potential is based on the number of patients with specific diagnoses (“nosology” or “ICDs”) that a medical rep recorded during last visit to that doctor. The number of patients is compared with the values in the
 
 Doctor’s potential setup
 
 lookup.
 



 The
 
 Loyalty
 
 field contains a general estimation of doctor’s loyalty towards your brand. Loyalty is an indicator of how actively the doctor promotes your products. By default, the loyalty can range from “1” (highest) to “3” (lowest). The loyalty value is calculated based on the actual prescriptions of your products by the doctor. The number of prescriptions is compared to the values in the
 
 Doctor’s loyalty setup
 
 lookup.
 



 The values in the
 
 Potential
 
 and
 
 Loyalty
 
 fields are calculated automatically during doctor categorization.
 



 The regional manager analyzes the “potential” and “loyalty” indicators and assigns doctor’s category. Information about previously assigned categories is automatically saved on the
 
 Categorization history
 
 detail on the contact’s page.
 



 Set up calculation of a doctor’s potential and loyalty indicators
-------------------------------------------------------------------



 A doctor’s
 **potential** 
 indicator depends on the number of patients with various diagnoses who visited the doctor. To set up calculation of the doctor’s potential:
 


1. Open system designer. For example, click the
 ![btn_system_designer_1.png](/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_system_designer_1.png)
 button.
2. Go to the
 
 Lookups
 
 section and open the
 
 Doctor’s potential setup
 
 lookup.
3. Add new lookup records and specify the values of doctor’s potential in the desired format. By default, there are three levels of potential (from highest to lowest): “A”, “B” and “C”.
4. Select the doctor specialty, for which the potential value is relevant.
 





 Note.
 
 Set up separate rules of calculating potential for different doctor specialties.
5. Assign the value range for the number of patients that visit a doctor of the selected specialty between the measurements (usually taken by a medical rep during visits).
 





 Note.
 
 To let medical reps enter data for calculation of potential, set up a connection between the doctor specialties and diagnoses (nosology) of the patients that visit each type of doctor. To do this, edit the records in the
 
 Nosology
 
 lookup.



 The doctor’s
 **loyalty** 
 indicator depends on the number of prescriptions for the promoted products the doctor makes between the medical rep’s visits. To set up calculation of the doctor’s loyalty:
 


1. Open system designer. For example, click the
 ![btn_system_designer_1.png](/docs/sites/default/files/inline-images/btn_system_designer_1.png)
 button.
2. Go to the
 
 Lookups
 
 section and open the
 
 Doctor’s loyalty setup
 
 lookup.
3. Add new lookup records and specify the values of doctor’s loyalty in the desired format. By default, the loyalty can range from “1” (highest) to “3” (lowest).
4. Select the doctor specialty, for which the potential value is relevant.
 





 Note.
 
 Set up separate rules for calculating loyalty for different doctor specialties.
5. Assign the value range for the number of prescriptions that a doctor of the selected specialty issues between measurements (usually taken by a medical rep during visits).
 





 Note.
 
 To let pharmaceutical reps enter data for calculation of doctor’s loyalty, enter the list of the promoted products in Creatio. You can do this by adding the products to the
 
 Promoted products
 
 detail on the
 
 Products
 
 tab of the doctor’s contact page, or by adding doctors to the
 
 Contacts
 
 detail of the product page.



 Perform doctor categorization
-------------------------------



 Doctor’s category is assigned by a regional manager and is based on analysis of the doctor’s potential and loyalty indicators. The doctor’s potential and loyalty are calculated based on the information about the number of doctor’s patients and the number of prescriptions of the promoted products issued by the doctor. The information is gathered by medial reps during visits. Creatio automatically assigns the doctor’s potential value if the number of patients is within the range specified for this value in the
 
 Doctor’s potential setup
 
 lookup.
 



 To perform doctor categorization:
 


1. Select one or more doctor records in the
 
 Contacts
 
 section.
 





 Note.
 
 You can also run the categorization action from the contact page, if a contact with the “Doctor” type is opened.
2. Click the
 
 Actions
 
 button and select
 
 Categorize
 
 .
 



 As a result, doctor’s potential and loyalty indicators will be calculated. The categorization will run on the background, and you will be notified when it completes.
3. Select doctor’s category based on the calculated potential and loyalty indicators. Information about previously assigned categories is automatically saved on the
 
 Categorization history detail
 
 on the contact’s page.
 





 Note.
 
 You can set up the list of categories in the
 
 Contact category
 
 lookup.
