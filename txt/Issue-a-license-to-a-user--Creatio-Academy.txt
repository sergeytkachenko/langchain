 You need to issue licenses to each new Creatio user. Only licensed users can log in to Creatio application and access the corresponding functionality. For example, users who have not been issued a “Creatio marketing” license, will not be able to use functions that are specific to Creatio marketing, such as the
 
 Email
 
 and the
 
 Campaigns
 
 sections. By default, Creatio system administrators have permission to distribute licenses to user accounts.
 





 Attention.
 
 To enable licensing a user account, Creatio must have available licenses that have not been distributed among other users.
 




 To license a user:
 


1. Click
