 If you use a load balancer to ensure fault tolerance of your Creatio application, the processes that involve the app compilation differ. You must perform the setup on one Creatio instance, then transfer the settings to other instances.
 



 Creatio runs the compilation automatically when you execute the following actions:
 


* 
* set up recordÂ permissions
* set up the changelog
* activate an additional UI language
* install packages that contain changes created and tested on other environments into a production environment
* install a Marketplace application.





 Note.
 
 We recommend performing the setup outside business hours since Creatio will be unavailable.
 




 View the general procedure to follow when Creatio compiles the app automatically below. The specifics might vary based on the load balancer you use with your Creatio application.
 


### 
 General setup procedure


1. **Set up a redirect** 
 to the placeholder page that explains the reasons for the downtime in the load balancer. Learn more about setting up redirects in the vendor documentation. For example,
 [HAProxy Enterprise](https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/hapee/latest/traffic-routing/redirects/) 
 .
2. **Stop all Creatio instances** 
 except one. Learn more in the Update guide:
 [Stopping the site](/docs/release/update-guide/update-guide#title-143-13) 
 .
3. **Back up** 
 the database. Learn more in the Update guide:
 [Creating database backup](/docs/release/update-guide/update-guide#title-143-2) 
 .
4. Perform the required process.
5. **Apply the changes** 
 on the web farm level. To do this, copy the contents of the following folders to every Creatio instance:
 


	* WebApp/conf/ and WebApp/Terrasoft.Configuration/Pkg for Creatio
	 **NET Framework**
	* Creatio root folder for Creatio
	 **.NET Core**
6. **Flush** 
 Redis.
7. **Start** 
 the stopped Creatio instances. Learn more in the Update guide:
 [Website starting, compilation and verification](/docs/release/update-guide/update-guide#title-143-14) 
 .
8. **Disable the redirect** 
 in the load balancer.
