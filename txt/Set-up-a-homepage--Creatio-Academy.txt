**Homepages** 
 aggregate the dashboard information for each workplace. Open the homepage from the side panel.
 



 Out of the box, Creatio includes homepages for all pre-configured workplaces: “Sales,” Marketing,” “Service,” etc. The homepages are displayed in the side panel at the top of the workplace section list. You can edit the content of existing homepages and create new homepages using no-code tools.
 





 Note.
 
 You can set up only one homepage per workplace but you can use a single homepage that has several workplaces.
 




 Homepage setup is performed by the system administrator or by a user that has the “Can manage configuration elements” (“CanManageSolution” code) operation permission. You can go to the homepage setup in multiple ways depending on whether you need to create a new or edit an existing homepage.
