 The lead duplicate search helps to obtain information about customers with similar needs and to eliminate duplicate leads. In contrast to searching for duplicate contacts and accounts, the duplicate search is not started manually. The results of the lead duplicate search are displayed automatically on the
 
 Similar leads
 
 detail of the lead page. Duplicates cannot be merged since several similar needs may arise from one customer.
 



 The lead duplicate search in Creatio is performed according to the pre-configured rules for searching for duplicates grouped as “Similar leads”. To enable or disable individual rules:
 


1. Click
