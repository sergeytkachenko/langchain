 When an email starts, all contacts that were added to the
 
 Audience
 
 detail will be sent an email generated according to the email template. Creatio sends emails in batches. The number of emails in a batch must not exceed 20,000 emails.
 



 Once the email starts, the information on the
 
 Template
 
 and
 
 Audience
 
 tabs, as well as in the
 
 Owner
 
 field becomes non-editable.
 



 Once the last batch of a bulk email is sent, its status is changed to “Sent”.
 


#### 
 Check the email progress



 You can see the email progress in the
 
 Status
 
 field, on the delivery diagram, as well as on the
 
 Email totals
 
 ,
 
 Sending progress
 
 , and
 
 Audience
 
 tabs.
 



 The email status is displayed in the
 
 Status
 
 field. The following email statuses are available in Creatio:
 


* **“WaitingBeforeSend”** 
 – the email is “on-hold”, waiting to be sent.
* **“PreparingToSend”** 
 – checking the available providers and preparing the email for sending.
* **“SendingInProgress”** 
 – Creatio is in the process of sending emails.
* **“Error”** 
 – an error has occurred during sending.
* **“Completed”** 
 – emails have been successfully sent.



 The
 **progress chart** 
 displayed on the email page shows the current sending and delivery status of your bulk email. Read more:

 Use the
 
 Email totals
 
 tab to view the latest updates about email deliveries and recipient responses and analyze “opens” and “clicks” dynamics. Read more:

 tab displays responses per recipient – delivered, opened, clicked, etc. This tab is updated gradually as Creatio receives and processes responses from the email provider. Read more:
