 The
 
 Wait for message
 
 intermediate event (Fig. 1) is used for resuming a business process branch when the corresponding
 [Throw message
 
 intermediate event](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7033) 
 is triggered within a current business process.

 intermediate event in a business process that waits for the “Invoice paid” message after issuing an invoice to a customer and then sends payment confirmation.

 intermediate event within the same process.

 Execution
  | 
 When the message is received by the
