 Use the MS Word reports to generate print-ready documents based on the section records. For example:
 


* Use reports of the
 
 Contracts
 
 section to print contracts.
* Use reports of the
 
 Contacts
 
 section to print contact summaries.
* Use reports of the
 
 Activities
 
 section to print out emails, minutes of meetings, etc.



 You can export reports as \*.docx files. Use
