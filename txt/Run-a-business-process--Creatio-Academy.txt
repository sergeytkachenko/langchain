 Learn more about how system administrators can run business processes in a separate article:
 [Run a process or a process step](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7098) 
 .
 





 Note.
 
 Regardless of the tool, you can only run business processes that can be launched manually, provided you have the corresponding permissions. Learn more in a separate article:
 [Set up the permissions to run a process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2348) 
 .
 




 Once a business process is run, Creatio adds a new
 **process instance** 
 that starts executing process steps. These steps can include include opening record pages, creating activities, etc.
 



 Creatio terminates the business process instance when the end event is triggered on the process diagram. You can start and stop business processes manually or have them start automatically.
 





 Attention.
 
 You can run only active published processes with the “Business Process” tag manually. Processes of other types cannot be run manually. If you try to run an unpublished or inactive process, Creatio displays an error message.

### 
 Run a process for multiple records in a section



 You can run a
 [section business process](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7152) 
 for multiple records at once. To do this:
 


1. Open the section where you want to run a process for multiple records, e. g.,
 
 Contacts
 
 .
2. Click
 
 Actions
 
 →
 
 Select multiple records
 
 .
3. Select the needed records.
4. Click
 
 Run process
 
 on the section toolbar and select the needed process.
 


 Note.
 
 The
 
 Run process
 
 button menu displays all processes you can run from the section. The processes in the menu are grouped by start type: from the section and from a record.




 Fig. 6 Run a process for multiple section records
 

![run_process_multiple_records_0.gif](/docs/sites/en/files/images/Platform_basics/run_business_process/run_process_multiple_records_0.gif)



 As a result, Creatio will run a separate process instance for every selected record. If one of the instances fails, other instances will continue running.
 



 Run a process automatically
-----------------------------



 Processes can be run automatically when certain events occur. These events include adding, modifying and deleting records. In this case, you do not need to run the process manually.
 



 Set up the automatic process start after an event in the
 [Process Designer](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7172) 
 .
