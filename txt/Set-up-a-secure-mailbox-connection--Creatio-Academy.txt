 Most email providers let third-party apps access the mailbox securely with the help of two-factor authentication and provider-generated passwords. This helps to protect your account and personal data. Email providers rarely block mailbox connection attempts so long as these measures are in place.
 



 As such, we recommend configuring your email for secure third-party app access before connecting the account to Creatio. You need to perform this setup on your email provider's end. The exact steps vary depending on your mailbox.
 



 There should be instructions on setting up third-party app passwords in your email provider's manual. You can find the guidelines for the most popular mailboxes below.
