 To
 **collaborate** 
 on business process design in Studio Creatio, free edition, you need to invite people to your team or join someone else's team. Business process design teams are represented with “
 **organization accounts.** 
 ”
 



 Once you complete your registration in Studio Creatio, free edition, you will have a user account and an organization account.
 


* **A user account** 
 is your personal account, that you use to log in to Studio Creatio, free edition.
* **An organization account** 
 is designed to share business processes and collaborate during the process design. By default, every new user who registers on their own (as opposed to being invited to someone’s account) has an organization account.



 There are two types of user roles in an organization account:
 


* **Can edit** 
 . Any user who has been
 **invited** 
 to the account by its administrator and accepted the invitation becomes the editor user. “Can edit” users can create, view, edit and delete all folders and business processes.
* **Administrator** 
 . Each user who signs up on their own (without an invitation), becomes an administrator of their own organization account. In addition to all “Can edit” privileges, administrator users can rename the account, invite other users to join, or remove users from the account. An organization can have more than one administrator, but at least one administrator is required.



 If one of the administrator users deletes their user account, other team members will be able to continue their work on the organization’s business processes. You cannot delete a single administrator user from an organization.

 As a result, the user will be sent an invitation to sign up with Studio Creatio, free edition. The invitation will display in your organization account settings as a new user with the specified role in the “
 **Invited** 
 ” status.
