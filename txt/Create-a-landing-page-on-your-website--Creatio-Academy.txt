 The first step of
 [landing integration](/docs/7-17/user/crm_tools/landing_pages_and_web_forms/landing_overview/setup_landing_general_information) 
 is to create a landing page.
 



 Create unique landing pages for each of your offers targeted at certain audiences. For example, use the following configurations:
 


* For first-time visitors, create a web-form for entering the email address to subscribe to your newsletter.
* For visitors interested in downloading valuable content, prepare a separate contact form.
* For customers who are ready to place an order, buy a service, or negotiate in person, create a detailed landing web-form.



 The more the landing page is fitted to the customer's maturity, the more potential customers will be willing to start communicating with your brand regardless of the decision-making stage they are at.
 



 To reach the maximum website conversion, follow the general recommendations for the landing page style, fields, and other UI elements.
 



 Page layout
-------------


* Create individual unique landing pages for each of your offers.
* Try to convey the message in the header of your landing page as precisely as possible.
* The landing page design must be user-friendly for the target audience.
* Use concise wording and avoid walls of unstructured text.



 Landing page fields
---------------------


* Design your data collection form to make sure you will get the most relevant information from your customers without asking them to input too much information.
* At least one form field must collect the customer contact information, such as the email or phone number. We recommend that you make these fields required.
* Make sure that the customers who fill out your landing page webform have a clear understanding of the fact that they are sharing their contact information and are ready to communicate with your brand. Include a field in your landing page form that the customers will use to confirm that they agree to receive marketing materials (“opt-in”).
* Use data entry validity check for the most important fields of the form to get the valid contact information from the customers.





 Note.
 
 You can set up
 [automatic completion](/docs/7-17/user/crm_tools/landing_pages_and_web_forms/faq/landing_page_setup_faq) 
 of the web forms on your landing pages with Creatio contact data (name, email, phone, etc.) of the contact who opened the landing page by clicking a link in a Creatio bulk email.
 




 Call to action and redirects
------------------------------


* A call-to-action button (such as “Buy,” “Sign up,” “Watch the demo,” etc) must be available.
* Create a page that your customer will be redirected to upon clicking a call-to-action button.



 After setting up the landing page, proceed to
 [set up the connection](/docs/7-17/user/crm_tools/landing_pages_and_web_forms/web_to_object/connect_a_landing_to_creatio/connect_your_website_landing_page_to_Creatio) 
 of the landing page to Creatio
