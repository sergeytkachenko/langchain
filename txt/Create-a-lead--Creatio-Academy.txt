 A lead is an interest in your products expressed by a potential customer. For example, new leads emerge if new users have registered on your website or if you receive a call from a contact who was previously interested in your services. With Creatio leads, you can work both with the customers who are ready to make a deal or those who need some more time to consider a purchase.
 



 In Creatio, a lead can be created in the following ways:
 


* added manually in the
 
 Leads
 
 section
* [imported](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=base&ver=7&id=1252) 

 from Excel
* created automatically via registering on a
 
[landing page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=1081) 

 .





 Note.
 
 If the
 
 Create contact
 
 checkbox is selected for a webpage in the "Landings" section, then when a consumer fills in the form of this landing, Creatio automatically creates a lead and a contact.
 




 Using the Leads section, you can manage the lead nurturing process from the moment a potential customer expresses an interest in your products up to the handoff to sales.

1. Go to the
 
 Leads
