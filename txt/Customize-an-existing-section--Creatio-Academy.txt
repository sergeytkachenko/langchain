 You can customize most of the out-of-the-box standard Creatio sections using the Section Wizard.
 





 Attention.
 
 Some of the sections can only be edited by developer means. The Section Wizard is unavailable in any sections designed for configuring the Creatio application (these are sections that are available in the
 
 Studio
 
 workplace or the System Designer, such as the
 
 Process library
 
 ,
 
 System settings
 
 ,
 
 Lookups
 
 , etc.); as well as non-standard sections, such as
 
 Agent desktop
 
 ,
 
 Queues
 
 ,
 
 Forecasts
 
 ,
 
 Marketing plans
 
 ,
 
 Dashboards
 
 , etc. Non-standard sections, usually, have their specific customization tools.

1. Open the needed section, e.g. the
 
 Requests
 
 section that you created earlier.
2. Click

 Attention.
 
 You can open the Section Wizard only if you have access to the
 
 Access to “Configuration” section
 
 system operation.
 






 Note.
 
 With the
 
 Activities
 
 section, you can only open the Section Wizard if you use the “List” view.
 




 As a result, you will switch to the Section Wizard of the current (e.g., “Requests”) section and will be able to configure it as per your business needs.
 





 Note.
 
 In the Section Wizard of the current section, you can configure the section business rules and cases. Read more in the “
