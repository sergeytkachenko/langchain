 Use the best practices and increase your chances to successfully close the deal by following the
 **corporate sale process** 
 steps.
 



 Processing an opportunity by the corporate sale process suggests handling an opportunity by stages, starting with qualification. This may lead to creating activities and opening additional pages in Creatio. As these activities are completed, their results influence the process flow.
 



 Process specifics:
 


* All activities are displayed on the action panel at the top of the opportunity page. The responsible employee receives notifications in the notification center and can see the activities in their calendar.
* You can perform a task directly in the action panel via the mini pages or by opening the task page.
* You can go from one process stage to another in the order that is convenient for you. Each stage can be performed as many times as required to manage an opportunity.
* When you advance an opportunity through stages, all uncompleted tasks of the previous stage will be canceled, while the current stage will create the needed activities regardless of whether the opportunity has already gone though this stage or not.
* Once you advance the opportunity to the final stage, you will not be able to come back to previous stages.



 You can view detailed information on the process steps in the process library.
 








 Run corporate sale process
---------------------------------



 There are several convenient ways for you to
 **start** 
 the corporate sales process. For example, If you start working with a new opportunity, we recommend that you run the process from the side panel or from it the command line. In this a case, the opportunity will be created while running the process. If you manually created an opportunity earlier, and now wish to continue working with it, use the corresponding command on the opportunity page.
 


### 
 Run a process from the side panel


1. In the

#### 
 Result



 If the stage was successfully completed, the opportunity will have a “Closed won” status.
 


### 



 Process termination



 The final stage is an important component of any sale, as at this stage you can determine the real amount of income and number of hours spent on the sale. Detailed information on the opportunity enables providing analytics of the won/lost opportunities and planning the sales department activity more effectively.
 



 You can complete the corporate sales process at any stage. To do this, select one of the final stages:
 


* Select ”
 **Closed won** 
 ” if the opportunity was completed successfully. For example, when you signed a contract with the customer. Check if the information on the opportunity page is up to date, create an order and schedule the activities related to the customer. The responsible manager will receive a notification about the successful sale.
* Select ”
 **Closed lost** 
 ” if the opportunity was not completed successfully. The responsible manager will receive a notification about the unsuccessful sale.





 Note.
 
 You can determine the list of final stages in the
