 The
 
 Throw message
 
 intermediate event (Fig. 1) is used to broadcast messages within a current business process. The generated message will activate a
 [Wait for message](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=7030)
 element or a
 Message
 start element within the same process.

 For example, the “Invoice is paid” message is thrown by the
 
 Throw message
 
 intermediate event within a business process for checking invoice payments. This message triggers all “Invoice is paid”
 
 Wait for message
 
 events in this process (Fig. 2).

 The same
 
 Throw message
 
 event can initiate event sub-processes within the current business process (Fig. 3)

 The message generated by the
 
 Throw message
 
 event cannot be sent to a different process.

 elements within the process that are configured accordingly to catch this specified message.
  |
| 
 Execution
  | 
 After broadcasting the message, the
 
 Throw message
 
 element activates its outgoing flows.
