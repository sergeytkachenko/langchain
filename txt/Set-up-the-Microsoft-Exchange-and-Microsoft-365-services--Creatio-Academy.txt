 To set up connection parameters for email providers, a user must have the permission to run the “Access to “Access rights” workspace” (“CanManageAdministration” code) system operation. Learn more about using system operations in a separate article:
 [System operation permissions](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2000) 
 .
 





 Note.
 
 Set up the
 [Exchange Listener](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2074) 
 synchronization service before setting up an email provider.

8. Fill out the additional settings to set up receiving and sending emails, specify the login format, service name and the authentication method if needed (Fig. 4).
 





 Note.
 
 Setting up passwordless OAuth authentication for Microsoft 365 requires an existing OAuth application. Learn more in a separate article:
 [Set up OAuth authentication for MS Office 365](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?id=2154) 
 .

1. **To enable receiving and sending emails** 
 :
 



 Select the
 
 Receive emails
 
 and/or
 
 Send emails
 
 checkbox.
 



 Select at least one checkbox.
2. **To set up the mailbox login format:** 



	* Select
	 
	 Use manual entry
	 
	 if users must enter their email address and username.
	* Select
	 
	 Use email address
	 
	 option if the full email address is used as a login, for example, “test@google.com.”
	* Select the
	 
	 Use mailbox name
	 
	 option if the part of the email address before “@” is used as a login. For example, the “test” will be a login for “test@google.com” email address.
3. **To set up the authentication method:** 






 Warning.
 
 Microsoft is deprecating the login and password authentication (Basic Authentication) method since it is obsolete and insecure. We recommend setting up secure OAuth authentication so that you do not lose access to your mailboxes from Creatio.
 



	* Select “OAuth 2.0” to restrict the service access to protected user resources without the need to pass the login and password. Fill out the
	 
	 Application (client) ID
	 
	 and
	 
	 Client secret
	 
	 required fields.
	 
	
	
	
	
	 Application (client) ID
	 
	 is generated by the Microsoft authentication server. The documentation and API may refer to the application ID as “Product ID.”
	 
	
	
	
	
	 Client secret
	 
	 – a secret key generated by the authentication server. The documentation and API may refer to the client secret as “Product key.”
	* Select “Basic” for the basic authentication using the user name and password with Base64 encryption.
4. Save the settings.
 



 As a result, Creatio users will be able to use the email provider to send and receive email messages.



 Method 2. Add the email provider from the user profile
--------------------------------------------------------


1. Open the user profile page by clicking the
 
 Profile
 
 image button on the Creatio main page.
2. Click

 (Fig. 1). This opens a box

3. Click

 in the box that opens.
 



**Take steps 3–9** 
 described above in
 **Method 1** 
 to complete the setup.
