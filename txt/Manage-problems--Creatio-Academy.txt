 Creatio implements the "Problem management" ITSM process in the
 
 Problems
 
 section. Use this section to manage registered problems and plan the working time for problem resolution. Effective problem management decreases the influence of cases on service performance and prevents further cases.
 



 A “problem” is the root cause of one or more occurred (possible) cases. For example, frequent breakdowns of a certain product node can be identified as a “problem.”
 





 Identify problems
---------------------



 Identify problems by analyzing multiple similar incidents and determining their common cause. Multiple incidents linked to the same service or configuration item, indicate a problem with that element of the IT infrastructure or the elements it depends on. To identify the faulty element:
 


* Check the values of the
 
 Service
 
 and
 
 Configuration item
 
 fields on the incident page.
* Check the dependencies of the incident service and configuration item
 
[using the service model on the case page](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=studio&ver=7&id=1277) 

 .



 Once the problem has been identified, proceed with the problem registration:
 


1. Add a new record in the
 
 Problems
 
 section. There are several ways you can do so:
 


	1. Go to the
	 
	 Problems
	 
	 section and click
	 
	 New
	 
	 .
	2. To add a problem from the incident page, go to the
	 
	 Closure and feedback
	 
	 tab →
	 
	 Problems
	 
	 →
	 ![btn_com_add_tab.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_problems/btn_com_add_tab.png)
	 →
	 
	 New
	 
	 .
2. Populate the fields on the problem page:
 





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
 Subject
  | 
 Brief description of the problem.
  |
| 
 Description
  | 
 Detailed description of the problem. For example, specify the circumstances that contributed to the problem cause or its influence on service availability.
  |
| 
 Owner
  | 
 Service team member who is responsible for resolving the problem.
  |
| 
 Assigned team
  | 
 Group of specialists within the department who are responsible for resolving the selected problem. You can customize user groups as the elements of the organizational structure in the
 
[Roles and users
 
 section](https://academy.bpmonline.com/documents?product=administration&ver=7&id=259) 

 .
  |
| 
 Priority
  | 
 Relative importance of resolving the problem.
  |
3. Populate the fields on the
 
 Problem profile
 
 tab of the problem page:
 





|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| 
 Type
  | 
 Select the problem type, e.g., “Known error” or “Problem”.
  |
| 
 Service
  | 
 Specify the service where the problem is. Resolving the problem would require making changes to this service.
  |
| 
 Configuration item
  | 
 Specify the configuration item where the problem is. Resolving the problem would require making changes to this CI.
  |
4. Add incidents that are caused by the problem to the
 
 Cases
 
 detail by clicking
 
 Problem profile
 
 →
 
 Cases
 
 →
 ![btn_com_add_tab00001.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_problems/btn_com_add_tab00001.png)
 and selecting checkboxes next to the corresponding incidents.
5. Click
 
 Save
 
 .
 



 As a result, a new problem record will be created. And the incidents caused by the problem will be added to the
 
 Cases
 
 detail of the problem page.










 Determine the scope of a problem
-----------------------------------------



 Because of the complexity and interdependence of various elements in the IT infrastructure, the scope of a problem may be larger than simply the cases connected to the faulty service or CI. Use the service model to check other infrastructure elements that may be affected by the problem. As a result, additional incidents may be linked to the problem.
 



 To view relations between a service and a configuration item:
 


1. Open the
 
 Problems
 
 section.
2. Select a record in the section list and click
 
 Open
 
 .
3. In the
 
 Actions
 
 menu of the problem page, select the
 
 Display configurations relations
 
 or
 
 Display service relations
 
 option (
 [Fig. 1](#XREF_64985_117)
 ).

 action
 

![scr_specs_problems_open_srm.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_problems/scr_specs_problems_open_srm.png)



 As a result, a service connection diagram for the selected IT infrastructure item will display (
 [Fig. 2](#XREF_74704_125)
 ).

![scr_section_service_requests_srm_display.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/itsm_tools/BPMonlineHelp/manage_problems/scr_section_service_requests_srm_display.png)


1. The
 
 Display service relations
 
 action opens a connection diagram for the service specified in the
 
 Service
 
 field of the problem page.
2. The
 
 Display configuration relations
 
 action opens a connection diagram for the configuration item specified in the
 
 Configuration item
 
 field of the problem page.
 



 As a result of using the connection diagrams, a service team specialist can define which IT infrastructure items cause the current problem. The faulty item of the IT infrastructure is considered the most probable reason for service delivery failure.
 





 Note.
 
 Learn more about working with the connection diagram in the
 
 “
 [Use service model for case management”](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=service%20enterprise&ver=7&id=1277) 

 article.





 Resolve and close problems
------------------------------



 The problems are resolved by finding temporary workarounds or making
 
[changes](https://academy.creatio.com/documents?product=service%20enterprise&ver=7&id=1067) 

 to the IT infrastructure. Once a solution to a problem is implemented, the problem management process requires that the corresponding problem is marked as “resolved” and eventually – “Closed.”
 



 To do so:
 


1. Open the resolved problem page. There are several ways you can do this:
 


	1. Go to the
	 
	 Problems
	 
	 section, select the needed record, and click
	 
	 Open
	 
	 .
	2. To open a problem from the change page, go to the
	 
	 Classification
	 
	 tab →
	 
	 Problems
	 
	 and click the needed problem record.
2. In the
 
 Status
 
 field of the problem page, select the needed status:
 


	1. Select “Resolved” when the change has been implemented, or if a workaround has been accepted temporarily.
	2. Select “Closed” when you have a confirmation that the problem has been eliminated as part of a change.
3. Populate the fields on the
 
 Resolution
 
 tab:
 





|
|  |
|
| 
 Resolution
  | 
 Describe how the problem was resolved as a result of the change.
  |
| 
 Actual resolution time
  | 
 Date when the problem was resolved.
  |
| 
 Closed on
  | 
 Date when the problem was finally closed.
  |
4. Click
 
 Save
 
 .
