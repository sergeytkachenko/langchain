 Why are price calculations incorrect during product selection?
------------------------------------------------------------------



 The product price in order, and invoices issued based on that order, may display incorrectly if the
 
 Products
 
 detail page has incorrect or no values in the following fields:
 
 Unit of measure
 
 ,
 
 Tax
 
 ,
 
 Currency
 
 ,
 
 Price
 
 . Check if all the mentioned fields are filled in correctly for all records on the
 
 Products
 
 detail on the order page. To ensure that the price is updated in the order, select the source price list on the
 
 Products
 
 detail once again and save the record.
 





 How is tax amount calculated when a product is added?
---------------------------------------------------------



 By default, the tax amount is included in the product price that you enter in Creatio. To change this logic, disable the
 
 Default value
 
 checkbox in the
 
 Price includes taxes
 
 system setting.
