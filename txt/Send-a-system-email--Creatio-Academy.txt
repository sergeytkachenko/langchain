 Use this function to send important non-marketing emails, such as notifications about updates or service unavailability. System email ignores the “Do not use email” checkbox if it is selected on the
 
 Communication channels
 
 tab of the recipient’s contact record and sends an email to the contact.
 



 Use system emails to send only service, transaction emails and important customer notifications. Using system emails for marketing purposes might lead to issues with the domain reputation and decrease the email deliverability.
 



 To convert a marketing email to a system email, select the
 
 System email
 
 checkbox on the
 
 Parameters
 
 tab when creating a new email (Fig. 1).
