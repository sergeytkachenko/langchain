 This article lists keyboard shortcuts available in Creatio (a.k.a. “Hotkeys”). Using keyboard shortcuts improves your efficiency by decreasing the time spent on frequent micro-operations, such as saving mini pages, navigating lists, working with the campaign designer.
 



 In the below table, you can find the most often used keyboard shortcuts.

 The table contains the shortcuts used for Windows OS. For Mac OS, use the “Command” key instead of “Ctrl”
