 Before you start creating reports, install the Creatio plug-in for MS Word.
 



 Select the plug-in depending on whether your MS Word application is 32 or 64 bit. You can determine whether your system is 32 or 64 bit using the
 [Microsoft instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) 
 . Most often, the 32-Bit MS Word plug-in is installed on the 64-bit Windows.

 For proper installation of the plugin unpack the archive with installation files. If the installation is started directly from the archive, the archiver application can cause failures in the work of the installer.
 


1. Before installing the Creatio plug-in for MS Word, make sure that your computer runtime environment meets the plug-in software requirements.
 


	1. Operating system: Windows 7 or higher Operating system (32-bit and 64-bit editions are supported):
	 
	
	
	
	
	
	 Note.
	 
	 The installation wizard will check whether the .NET Framework is installed, which is necessary for the plug-in to work. You can download .NET Framework free from the Microsoft website.
	2. The plug-in supports: MS Word 2010 and up MS Word 2003 and MS Word 2007 are not supported.
2. Make sure that the MS Word application installed on your computer is closed.
 



 If you have the “MS Word Report Designer” plug-in installed, uninstall it.
3. Run the Creatio MS Word Report Designer.exe installer as Administrator. If you try installing the new plug-in and do not uninstall the old one, Creatio will return an error message. In this case, stop the installation, uninstall the old plug-in and run the installer again.
4. Run MS Word as Administrator after installing the plug-in. You only need to do it once in order to update the application's settings.
 


 When the plug-in installation is over, you can start
