 Grant permissions to export lists of either specific objects or all Creatio sections to roles and individual users.
 



 Data export permissions are a subset of Creatio
 [object permissions](/docs/7-16/user/setup_and_administration/user_and_access_management/access_management/record_permissions_shortcut/record_permissions) 
 . You can grant full data export permissions to some roles and users. For example, the company management. To do this, grant them permission to the “Export list records” (the “CanExportGrid” code)
 [system operation](/docs/7-16/user/setup_and_administration/user_and_access_management/access_management/system_operation_permissions_shortcut/system_operation_permissions) 
 . If the information is confidential and sensitive, we recommend setting up export permissions for specific objects. For example, grant permission to export invoices to the finance department managers.
 





 Example.
 
 Set up permission to export only the invoice list for the “Finance department managers” role.
 



1. Go to the System designer. For example, click the

2. Go to the “Users and administration” block → “Object permissions.”
3. Find the needed section, lookup, or detail object in the Creatio object list. Apply the “Sections” filter and select the “Invoice” object.

 Invoices
 
 section object.
5. Go to the

 tab of the permission setup page.
6. Click the

 As a result, employees that have the “Finance department managers” role will be able to export only the
 
 Invoices
 
 section list. They will not be able to export other Creatio lists.
