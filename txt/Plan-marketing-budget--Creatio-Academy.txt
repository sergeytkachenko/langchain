 Use the
 
 Marketing plans
 
 section in Creatio to create marketing plans for promoting a brand, attracting new leads, schedule a series of activities, such as events, webinars, and bulk emails. You can manage your marketing activities in terms of weeks, months, and quarters.
 



 In the
 
 Marketing plans
 
 section, there are two types of records: a “marketing plan” and a “marketing activity.”
 



 A
 **marketing plan** 
 is a schedule of activities that comprises the marketing strategy of a company. The schedule contains several activities with assigned owners, deadlines, and budgets.
 



**Marketing activity** 
 is a specific activity within a marketing plan.
 





 Note.
 
 A list of marketing activities can be found in the
 
 Marketing plans
 
 section and is not to be confused with the
 
 Activity
 
 section records.
 




 All marketing plans can be viewed by clicking the
 ![btn_marketing_plans_plans.png](/sites/default/files/documents/docs_en/product/bpm'online marketing/marketing/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_marketing_plans/btn_marketing_plans_plans.png)
 button at the top of the section workspace.
 



 To view detailed information, open the page by clicking the marketing plan title.
 



 To view activities for all marketing plans, click the
 ![btn_marketing_plans_activities.png](/sites/default/files/documents/docs_en/product/bpm'online marketing/marketing/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_marketing_plans/btn_marketing_plans_activities.png)
 button.
 



 To view and analyze activities within each of the marketing plans, we recommend using standard filters or set up a custom folder in the
 
 Filter
 
 menu.
 





 Note.
 
 For example, to display the calendar of activities within a specific marketing plan, set up a standard filter for the
 
 Marketing plan
 
 column.
 




 By clicking the
 ![btn_marketing_plans_list_view.png](/sites/default/files/documents/docs_en/product/bpm'online marketing/marketing/7.16.0/BPMonlineHelp/section_marketing_plans/btn_marketing_plans_list_view.png)

 buttons at the top right of the workspace section, you can choose whether records are displayed as a
 **drop-down list** 
 or as
 **scheduled periods** 
 in the calendar (Fig. 1).
