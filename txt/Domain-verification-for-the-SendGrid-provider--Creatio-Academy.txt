 If you use SendGrid for sending marketing emails, you will need to verify your email address and your corporate domain to allow the provider to send emails on your behalf.
 



 If your recipients use MS Outlook, Hotmail, Gmail, and other common mailing services, they can see that an email was sent from your provider's server on your behalf (this information is available in the “From” field).
 





 Note.
 
 For example, if you are sending emails via SendGrid, the “From” field of the emails may contain the following text: “Your Manager <info@creatio.com> via sendgrid.net”.
 




 The procedure for domain verification for SendGrid consists of several stages:
 


1. Add your corporate domain on the
 
 Bulk email settings
 
 page.

2. Obtain MX-, SPF-, and DKIM records.

3. Specify MX-, SPF-, and DKIM records in the DNS area of your domain
 
[Read more >>>](#HT_section_email_getting_started_spf_sendgrid)





 Note.
 
 Only custom email domains can be verified. Public domains (for example, gmail.com, yahoo.com, etc.) cannot be verified. We do not recommend using public domains for bulk emails. Such emails have a high risk of being marked as spam and ruining the reputation of the sender IP address.
 




 Add your corporate domain on the
 
 Bulk email settings
 
 page
-----------------------------------------------------------------



 SendGrid users need to add their corporate domain to Creatio before starting their emails. To do so:
 


1. In the
 **Emails** 
 section, select
 **Bulk email settings** 
 in the
 **Actions** 
 menu (Fig. 1)

2. On the
 **Bulk email settings** 
 page, specify the domain of the necessary email address in the
 **Sender domain** 
 area, i.e., “mycompany.com” (Fig. 2).

 Get setup keys for your domain
--------------------------------



 MX-, SPF- and DKIM records are generated automatically in the
 **Email** 
 section once the domain is added to the email settings page. To obtain these records, in the
 **Email** 
 section, select
 **Email settings** 
 in the
 
 Actions
 
 menu.
 



 The SPF and DKIM records will be generated automatically in the
 **DKIM/SPF setup instructions** 
 area on the
 **Bulk email settings** 
 page (Fig. 3) for your specified domain once your email is verified.

 Attention.
 
 MX-, SPF- and DKIM records of the SendGrid provider are different for different domains.
 




 Add records to the DNS area of your domain
--------------------------------------------



 To verify the mail domain using the SendGrid provider, you need to add the MX, SPF to the DNS area of the mail domain settings, otherwise, the domain reputation and the mail delivery quality are not guaranteed.
 





 Note.
 
 We recommend looking into the examples provided in the
 [Recommendations on setting up the popular DNS providers article](/docs/8-0/user/setup_and_administration/email_domain_verification/recommendations_for_dns/recommendations_on_setting_up_the_popular_dns_providers) 
 .
 



##### 
 Specify MX record in the DNS area of your domain



**MX record** 
 is the primary record in the domain zone; it specifies mailing host names of the domain. The email server checks if MX records are available in the DNS zone and whether they match the sender’s IP address. If the data is unavailable or the IP addresses do not match, the remote server is very likely to deny sending and receiving emails.
 



 Unlike SPF and DKIM records, the syntax of MS records includes priorities.
 **Priority** 
 is specified as an integer; it indicates the order in which the availability of email servers is checked.  The highest possible priority is “0.” You can add several MS records with equal priority.
 



 An MX record looks like this:
 





| 
 Name
  | 
 Priority
  | 
 Type
  | 
 Value
  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 
 subdomain.yourdomain.com
  | 
 0
  | 
 mx
  | 
 mx.sendgrid.net.
  |




 The subdomain name is unique and is generated by the provider.
 


### 
 Specify SPF record in the DNS area of your domain



 Copy the generated SPF record from the
 **DKIM/SPF setup instructions** 
 area on the
 **Bulk email settings** 
 page, which will look as follows: The record will look as follows:
 





| 
 Name
  | 
 Type
  | 
 Value
  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
 subdomain.yourdomain.com
  | 
 TXT
  | 
 v=spf1 a mx include:\_spf.sendgrid.com ~all
  |




 The subdomain name is unique and is generated by the provider. Add a separate record for each subdomain.
 


### 
 Specify DKIM record in the DNS area of your domain



 After the configuration of the SPF record, you need to add DKIM records. For the SendGrid provider, the record should look like this:
 





| 
 Name
  | 
 Type
  | 
 Value
  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 
 m1.\_domainkey
  | 
 TXT
  | 
 k=rsa; t=s; p=XXXXXXXXXXXXX
  |




 In the record above, “XXXXXXXXXXXXX” is an
 **individual key** 
 for each domain. The key is generated automatically and is available on the
 **Sender domains** 
 tab.
 



 Certain DNS settings may require entering the provided subdomain in the “Host / Name” field in the following format: “m1.\_domainkey.yourdomain.com”
