 You can create the catalog structure based on categories, types, filter conditions, and other grouping criteria that you set for products. This enables you to classify and quickly search for the needed products.
 



 The product catalog is available in the folder tree of the
 
 Products
 
 section. To
 **open the product catalog** 
 , select
 
 Filters/folders
 
 →
 
 Show folders
 
 .:
 



 You can
 **set up catalog levels** 
 by certain grouping criteria, for example, by category and type. To do this, use the
 
 Set up product catalog
 
 option in the actions menu of the
 
 Products
 
 section (
 [Fig. 2](#XREF_27595_159)
 ).

 section.
2. In the
 
 Actions
 
 menu, select
 
 Set up product catalog
 
 .
3. On the product setup catalog page, click
 
 New
 
 .
4. On the page that opens, specify:
 


	1. Name – catalog level name that displays in the list of the catalog setup page.
	2. Product field – product page field, which is used for product categorization on this level of the catalog. For example, select the Category field so that the catalog folders on this level corre­spond to the product categories
	
	
	
	 Note.
	 
	 The catalog structure only displays the levels (folders) that have available records in Creatio. For example, if the “Hardware” category contains no products, then the “Hardware” level will not be displayed in the catalog structure.
