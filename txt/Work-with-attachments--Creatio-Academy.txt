 To work with additional information in Creatio, use the
 
 Attachments and notes
 
 tab. The tab contains the
 
 Attachments
 
 and
 
 Notes
 
 details.
 



 Use these details to store external files, links to web resources, and extended descriptions of the record. The tab is available in all system sections. For example, in the
 
 Contacts
 
 section, you can add documents that represent the history of your interactions with the contact; in the
 
 Activities
 
 section, add files that have been prepared within a task.
 



 The
 
 Attachments
 
 detail has the following views:
 



![btn_dtl_files_view_card.png](/guides/sites/en/files/documentation/user/en/base/BPMonlineHelp/chapter_files/btn_dtl_files_view_card.png)
 – the
 **tile** 
 view. In this view, the files and links added to the detail are displayed as icons. The icon appearance varies depending on the file extension.
 





 Note.
 
 The icons for different file types can be set up in the
 
 File extension
 
 lookup. For the files whose types are undefined in the lookup, a default icon is used.

 – the
