 The functionality of delegating permissions enables granting all access permissions of a user to another user for a limited time. This is useful when, for example, an employee is out of the office or otherwise unavailable and someone should take over their duties. You can delegate permissions of individual users or roles to any number of other users or roles.
 



 To delegate permissions, a user must have access to the “
 **Manage user list** 
 ” (CanManageUsers) and “
 **Change delegated permissions** 
 ” (CanChangeAdminUnitGrantedRight) system operations.
